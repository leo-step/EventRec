In 2018, for example, seven states in the western United States entered into the Colorado River Basin Weather Modification Agreement to try to augment snowpack. In response to unprecedented drought on the Yangtze River in summer 2022, the Chinese government stepped up its already extensive weather modification efforts. Moreover, intensified weather modification efforts have contributed to geopolitical tensions. Weather modification is also associated in the public imagination with solar radiation management, a highly controversial form of geoengineering. Despite the importance of weather modification in the context of climate change, it has not attracted much attention from geographers. Through the lens of several geographical concepts, Emily Yeh, professor of geography at University of Colorado-Boulder, considers practices of weather modification in the U.S., China, and the United Arab Emirates. These include China\u2019s \u201cSky River\u201d project that promised to seed clouds to move rain across the Tibetan Plateau.\\n\\nMeeting Link: https://princeton.zoom.us/j/92266282481\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934438"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081522", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20230825T105018", "CREATED": "20230825T120000", "SEQUENCE": "13", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"The Office of Undergraduate Research\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/OUR/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/OUR/rsvp_boot?id=1935313#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "OUR", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "General Event", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Mentorship,Research & Data Analysis,Teaching & Mentoring ,Undergraduate Research", "DTSTART": "20230914T160000Z", "DTEND": "20230914T170000Z", "UID": "0bb34d0db338e3e2e93b1c64bcc6e7f88252023_9:59:05_AM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "How to Become a ReMatch Mentor", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935313", "DESCRIPTION": "ReMatch is a research-mentoring program designed to connect undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers through their shared interest in academic research.

While many point to China's ecological civilization programs as a new paradigm for global environmental governance, Jesse Rodenbiker argues that ecological redlining extends the reach of the authoritarian state. Although Chinese urban sustainability initiatives have driven millions of citizens from their land and housing, Rodenbiker shows that these migrants are not passive subjects of state policy. Instead, they creatively navigate resettlement processes in pursuit of their own benefit. However, their resistance is limited by varied forms of state-backed infrastructural violence. Through extensive fieldwork with scientists, urban planners, and everyday citizens in southwestern China, \"Ecological States\" exposes the ways in which the scientific logics and practices fundamental to China's green urbanization have solidified state power and contributed to dispossession and social inequality.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934446"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081522", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20230811T105211", "CREATED": "20230804T120000", "SEQUENCE": "3", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"The Graduate School \"": "https://my.princeton.edu/ODOGS/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/ODOGS/rsvp_boot?id=1934577#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "ODOGS", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Evening Event", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Wellness & Community", "DTSTART": "20230914T203000Z", "DTEND": "20230914T230000Z", "UID": "4b9e09c48ba2b5427cf00ee6c5051b23842023_10:13:28_AM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Lawrence Community Welcome BBQ", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934577", "DESCRIPTION": "Come join us for a welcome barbeque at Lawrence Apartments to kick off the semester!

Ryo Morimoto is a first-generation student and scholar from Japan. His scholarly work addresses the planetary impacts of our past and present engagements with nuclear things. Regionally centered on Japan, Morimoto\u2019s research creates spaces, languages, and archives through which to think about nuclear things, along with other not immediately sensible contaminants, as part of what it means to live in the late industrial and postfallout era. He grounds his work in a range of theoretical frameworks\u2014including semiotic anthropology, anthropology of disaster, environmental anthropology, anthropology and the recent history of Japan, anthropology of science and technology, and digital humanities. Morimoto mobilizes them to explore the uses and applications of technologies in social processes whereby certain sensory-cognitive experiences are (im)materialized and to grapple with the techno-sensory politics that emerge in discourses concerning invisible things.

The huge pool of low-cost migrant labor has significantly bolstered the competitiveness of Chinese manufactured goods in the international market. Nonetheless, due to their lack of local household registration (hukou), these laborers cannot access various urban social benefits, leading to the separation of tens of millions of migrant families across different areas and giving rise to a host of challenges. In 2014, China inaugurated its New-type Urbanization Plan and undertook measures to reform the hukou system, committing to lower the proportion of the \"migrant\" population by 2020 and increasing migrant children's enrollment in schools. Drawing from 2020 Census data and recent policy documentation, this presentation offers an initial assessment of the main outcomes stemming from the 2014 plan, discusses the persisting obstacles China confronts in integrating the migrant population and the latest national and local endeavors to reform the hukou system.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935465"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081525", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20230915T111441", "CREATED": "20230831T120000", "SEQUENCE": "3", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"PICSciE/Research Computing\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/PICSciERC/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/PICSciERC/rsvp_boot?id=1935484#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PICSCIERC", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Training/Workshop", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Research & Data Analysis,Programming Languages", "DTSTART": "20230918T203000Z", "DTEND": "20230918T220000Z", "UID": "63fee2f188a48f3641eebd25535a702f8312023_10:49:27_AM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Managing Research Data", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935484", "DESCRIPTION": "This workshop is an introduction to recommended practices in research data management.

But the reasons for the Court\u2019s plummeting status in broad polls of public confidence \u2013 the reasons why a growing number of Americans now question its legitimacy \u2013 could be many.\u00a0\u00a0Which if any of those reasons might justify the conviction that it is time to rethink the Court\u2019s effective monopoly on constitutional meaning? The answer depends on what we think a court\u2019s job is \u2013 what a judge\u2019s or even a lawyer\u2019s job is \u2013 in the first place.

By interlacing these seemingly disparate, extreme and provocative experiences, he will shed light on the failure of the state, large international agencies and more generally, the private property market system. This failure to address land rights and adequate housing has polarized many cities across those that own private property, and those that are landless and homeless.  Amidst this visible tension, he will draw on everyday struggles for land and housing forced by social movements and community networks that are forcing a new reality in urban areas across the world. Ultimately, through these experiences, he will illustrate some of the empirical practices and tactics of co-production, negotiation, resistance and protest in developing policies for just and equal cities.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937053"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081530", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20230914T124248", "CREATED": "20230627T120000", "SEQUENCE": "9", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Princeton University Library\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/PULIB/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/PULIB/rsvp_boot?id=1934189#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PULIB", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Training/Workshop", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Undergraduate Research,Digital Technologies,Skill-Building", "DTSTART": "20230927T173000Z", "DTEND": "20230927T190000Z", "UID": "61ee08819fd272f57167c5959a1a36886272023_3:37:22_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Using Tables and Maps together in ArcGIS Pro", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934189", "DESCRIPTION": "ArcGIS Pro has many different ways to access data sets, display them in a map, and analyze relationships over time and space.

She is the author most recently of The Lives of Jessie Sampter: Queer, Disabled, Zionist, which tells the story of an individual full of contradictions. Jessie Sampter (1883\u20131938) was best known for her Course in Zionism (1915), an American primer for understanding support of a Jewish state in Palestine. In 1919, Sampter packed a trousseau, declared herself \u201cmarried to Palestine,\u201d and immigrated there. Yet Sampter\u2019s own life and body hardly matched typical Zionist ideals. Although she identified with Judaism, Sampter took up and experimented with spiritual practices from various religions. While Zionism celebrated the strong and healthy body, she spoke of herself as \u201ccrippled\u201d from polio and plagued by sickness her whole life. While Zionism applauded reproductive women\u2019s bodies, Sampter never married or bore children; in fact, she wrote of homoerotic longings and had same-sex relationships. By charting how Sampter\u2019s life did not neatly line up with her own religious and political ideals, Imhoff highlights the complicated and at times conflicting connections between the body, queerness, disability, religion, and nationalism.. . . . Prof. Imhoff will be interviewed by CCSR Post-doctoral Fellow Lauren K. McCormick.. . . . The 2023-2024 theme for the Religion and the Public Conversation series is \"Bodies and Embodiment.\" . . . .

After two years in the White House, an aging and increasingly unpopular Ronald Reagan looked like a one-term president, but in 1983 something changed. Reagan spoke of his embattled agenda as a spiritual rather than a political project and cast his vision for limited government and market economics as the natural outworking of religious conviction. The news media broadcast this message with enthusiasm, and white evangelicals rallied to the president\u2019s cause. With their support, Reagan won reelection and continued to dismantle the welfare state, unraveling a political consensus that stood for half a century. In Righting the American Dream, Diane Winston reveals how support for Reagan emerged from a new religious vision of American identity circulating in the popular press. Through four key events\u2014the \u201cevil empire\u201d speech, AIDS outbreak, invasion of Grenada, and rise in American poverty rates\u2014Winston shows that many journalists uncritically adopted Reagan\u2019s religious rhetoric and ultimately mainstreamed otherwise unpopular evangelical ideas about individual responsibility. The result is a provocative new account of how Reagan together with the press turned America to the right and initiated a social revolution that continues today.. . . .

Simpson International Building, Room A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, , ", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936524", "DESCRIPTION": "This talk will begin with broadly discussing opportunities and concerns in the deployment and goveranace of information and communication technologies to advance social equity focusing on India's digital stack (biometric ID and direct bank payment transfers). The second part of the talk will focus on community-based research in Andhrapradesh from the book, \"Patching Development: Information Politics and Social Change in India,\" which asks the following key question: How can development programs deliver benefits to marginalized citizens in ways that expand their rights and freedoms? Political will and good policy design are critical but often insufficient due to resistance from entrenched local power systems. The book introduces the concept of \"patching development\" as a top-down, fine-grained, iterative socio-technical process that makes local information about implementation visible through technology and enlists participation from marginalized citizens through social audits. These processes are neither neat nor orderly and have led to a contentious sphere where the exercise of power over documents, institutions and technology is intricate, fluid and highly situated. The book throws new light on the challenges and benefits of using information and technology in novel ways to implement development programs. \\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936524"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081537", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231009T061106", "CREATED": "20230918T120000", "SEQUENCE": "9", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Program in Translation and Intercultural Communications\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/PIIRSPTIC/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/PIIRSPTIC/rsvp_boot?id=1936638#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PIIRSPTIC", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Lecture", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Humanities,Global/Intercultural,Virtual/Zoom Event", "DTSTART": "20231010T160000Z", "DTEND": "20231010T172000Z", "UID": "875a102e28b91e4daf3775b95476a5579182023_9:53:36_AM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Ilya Kaminsky and Lesyk Panasiuk on Writing and Translating Poetry in Times of War", "LOCATION": "Online Event", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936638", "DESCRIPTION": "Join the Program in Translation and Intercultural Communication (PTIC) to hear American poet and scholar Ilya Kaminsky and Ukrainian poet and translator Lesyk Panasiuk talk about their experiences writing and translating poetry during the Russian war against Ukraine.

To grow up in the 1950s was to enter a world of polarized national alliances, nuclear threat, and destabilized social hierarchies. Two world wars and the depression that connected them had unleashed a torrent of expectations and dissatisfactions\u2014not only in global affairs but in American society and Americans\u2019 lives.. . . . A privileged white girl in conservative, segregated Virginia was expected to adopt a willful blindness to the inequities of race and the constraints of gender. For Drew Gilpin, the acceptance of both female subordination and racial hierarchy proved intolerable and galvanizing. Urged to become \u201cwell adjusted\u201d and to fill the role of a poised young lady that her upbringing imposed, she found resistance was necessary for her survival. During the 1960s, through her love of learning and her active engagement in the civil rights, student, and antiwar movements, Drew forged a path of her own\u2014one that would eventually lead her to become a historian of the very conflicts that were instrumental in shaping the world she grew up in.. . . . Culminating in the upheavals of 1968, Necessary Trouble captures a time of rapid change and fierce reaction in one young woman\u2019s life, tracing the transformations and aftershocks that we continue to grapple with today. . . . . Drew Gilpin Faust is University Professor of History at Harvard University. She was Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study from 2001 to 2007 and served as Harvard\u2019s president from 2007 to 2018. Faust is the author of several books, including This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War, winner of the Bancroft Prize and a finalist for the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize; and Mothers of Invention: Women of the Slaveholding South in the American Civil War. Shirley Tilghman served as President of Princeton University from 2001-2013 and is Professor of Molecular Biology and Public Affairs at Princeton. In 2002, Discover Magazine recognized her as one of the 50 most important women in science.. . . .

Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, one of the most forceful and clear progressive voices in the US today, joins the author for a conversation.. . . . Marcus argues that the defining texts in twentieth-century American cultural history are records of political disappointment. Through often surprising readings of literature and sound, Marcus offers a new cultural history of the last century, in which creative minds observed the passing of moments of possibility, took stock of the losses sustained, and fostered intellectual revolutions and unexpected solidarities.. . . . In close readings of writings, song, and poetry from figures such as Du Bois to Lead Belly or Audre Lorde, among many others, Marcus shows how defeat time and again gave rise to novel modes of protest and new forms of collective practice, keeping alive the dream of a better world. Disappointment has proved to be a durable, perhaps even inevitable, feature of the democratic project, yet so too has the resistance it precipitates.. . . . Sara Marcus is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Notre Dame and the author of Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution, a finalist for the National Award for Arts Writing. Keeanga Yamahtta Taylor\u2019s Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.

In this collection of imaginative vignettes, Yablonska describes her round-the-world journey from France to Port Said, Colombo, Saigon, Bangkok, and all the way to Bora Bora. The travelogue not only documents her wanderlust, but invites the reader on an introspective journey from perception to reflection, from mapping foreign terrain to self-mapping.. . . . The figure of Sofia Yablonska is complex and unconventional \u2014 just like her writings, which have only recently been rediscovered and properly appreciated. Why should it now be the turn of readers beyond Ukrainian borders to discover Yablonska?

And does it even make sense to do so, given the number of urgent texts dealing with the Russian war against Ukraine that need to be translated and published?

As Eziaku Nwokocha reveals in this richly textured book, that connection is manifest in the dynamic relationship between public religious ceremonies, material aesthetics, bodily adornment, and spirit possession. Nwokocha spent more than a decade observing Vodou ceremonies from Montreal and New York to Miami and Port-au-Prince. She engaged particularly with a Haitian practitioner and former fashion designer, Manbo Maude, who presided over Vodou temples in Mattapan, Massachusetts, and Jacmel, Haiti. With vivid description and nuanced analysis, Nwokocha shows how Manbo Maude's use of dress and her production of ritual garments are key to serving Black gods and illuminate a larger transnational economy of fashion and spiritual exchange. This innovative book centers on fashion and other forms of self-presentation, yet it draws together many strands of thought and practice, showing how religion is a multisensorial experience of engagement with what the gods want and demand from worshippers. Nwokocha's ethnographic work will challenge and enrich readers' understandings not only of Vodou and its place in Black religious experience but also of religion's entanglements with gender and sexuality, race, and the material and spiritual realms.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938046"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081544", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231009T130350", "CREATED": "20230817T120000", "SEQUENCE": "56", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"GradFUTURES\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/GradFUTURES/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/GradFUTURES/rsvp_boot?id=1934917#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "GRADFUTURES", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Meeting", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Careers & Professional Development,GradFUTURES Learning Cohort,Industry Exploration,Skill-Building", "DTSTART": "20231026T210000Z", "DTEND": "20231026T230000Z", "UID": "ed6e4bebf95a373c0535e24975b566628172023_4:53:33_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Business Skills for PhDs in Academia and Beyond: Thinking Strategically & Leveraging Capabilities", "LOCATION": "Julis Romo Rabinowitz A17, Julis Romo Rabinowitz A17, Princeton, NJ, United States", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934917", "DESCRIPTION": "Instructor: Michael Lenox, Tayloe Murphy Professor of Business Administration, Special Advisor for the Dean, UVA Darden School of Business\u00a0. . . .

The groundbreaking feminist historian and political thinker Joan Scott will help guide the journey. Please join us.. . . . Ever since the days of Pythagoras in the 6th century BCE, humans have been dreaming up better ways to organize how we live together, share our property, raise our children, and determine who\u2019s part of our families. Some of these experiments burned brightly for only a brief while\u2014but others carry on today.. . . . Kristen  Ghodsee takes the reader on a tour through history and around the world to explore those places that have boldly dared to reimagine how we might live our daily lives: from the Danish cohousing communities that share chores and deepen neighborly bonds to matriarchal Colombian ecovillages where residents grow all their own food; and from Connecticut, where new laws make it easier for extra \u201calloparents\u201d to help raise children not their own, to China, where planned microdistricts ensure everything a busy household might need is nearby.. . . . One of those startlingly rare books that upends what you think is possible, Everyday Utopia offers a radically hopeful vision for how to build more contented and connected societies, alongside a practical guide to what we all can do in the meantime to live the good life each and every day.. . . . Kristen R. Ghodsee is a Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the critically acclaimed author of Why Women Have Better Sex Under Socialism: And Other Arguments for Economic Independence. Her writing has been published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Republic, Le Monde Diplomatique, and Jacobin, among other outlets.  Joan Scott\u2019 is professor emerita in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study. She is recognized as one of the foundational feminist historians. Her influential books include Gender and the Politics of History; The Politics of the Veil; The Fantasy of Feminist History; Sex and Secularism; Knowledge, Power, and Academic Freedom; and On the Judgement of History.. . . .

An essay formulated, perhaps, in the manner of those who listen to footsteps on the Earth, akin to the practices of healing with plants and to dances of transition and transformation, related to the temporality in which poetry or handicrafts are formed, somewhat outside the classic contemporary discourse on art. We present here a constellation of intuitions, knowledge and practices on the colonial invention of bodies based on the imposition of a hierarchy of skin, sexuality, gender and ethnic identity and the banning of certain individual and community erotic, visual and spiritual practices. We  will attest to the powerful beauty of the invocations against the effects of the colonial trauma and the permanent resistance against it in our bodies. The Rhea\u2019s Footprint (Or How We Transform Silences) enables us to chart a counter-history of the bodies of the constellations of the south, bodies that today we would term transvestite/trans/non-binary.. . . . You are invited to a talk about the exhibition The Rhea's footprint (or how we transform silences) which is currently on display at the Cultural Center of Memory Haroldo Conti in Buenos Aires, Argentina, after being shown at La Virreina Museum of Barcelona and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Panama. The exhibition, curated by R\u00edo Paran\u00e1 (Mag De Santo & Duen Neka'hen Sacch) brings together works by trans, travesti, non-binary, queer and bisexual artists from a diversity of cultures and origins in our Americas.

At the same time, the critical tendency to situate Eliot in relation to a New Testament paradigm has obscured her engagement with cosmologies other than the Christian telos. Disambiguating incarnation from the New Testament legacy \u2014 but not from religion \u2014 this talk traces Eliot\u2019s interest in forms of ensouled embodiment that take shape in multiple iterations over time. Inspired by calls to reimagine the geographical and chronological boundaries of Victorian studies, this talk pairs Middlemarch (1871-72) with a 20th-century Urdu novel that makes reincarnation its organizing narrative principle: Qurratulain Hyder\u2019s Aag ka Darya (1959)/River of Fire (trans. 1998), a historical epic that sees its characters repeatedly reborn over the course of 2500 years. In examining how both novels theorize history by engaging with Hindu and Buddhist models of spiritual embodiment, this talk demonstrates what becomes possible when we consider the relationship between literary form and religious doctrine outside the Christian context.. . . .

This paper argues that the anti-caste articulations are as old as caste itself. Using the Telugu-speaking areas as a historical site, this paper tracks the anti-caste epistemology articulated by Dalits for centuries in the forms of oral and folk traditions. With the dawn of colonial modernity, anti-caste articulations in the form of literary journals, texts, and political pamphlets in the colonial public sphere challenged caste inequality and Brahmanical power and supremacy. The paper uses Kula (Caste) Puranas of the marginalized communities as an oral resistance tradition and the Telugu publications of Dalits and anti-caste writers to build an alternative anti-caste epistemology that resisted Brahmanical oppression and envisioned egalitarian philosophy of equality and dignity as a precondition for human emancipation.. . . . Chinnaiah Jangam is an associate professor in the Department of History at Carleton University.

This seminar invites scholars to discuss the future of \u201cSoviet studies\u201d and to share thoughts and ideas about research and teaching.. . \\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934958"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081550", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20230905T115318", "CREATED": "20230905T120000", "SEQUENCE": "1", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Princeton University Library\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/PULIB/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/PULIB/rsvp_boot?id=1935763#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PULIB", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Training/Workshop", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Digital Technologies,GradFUTURES Learning Cohort,Undergraduate Research,Research & Data Analysis", "DTSTART": "20231103T173000Z", "DTEND": "20231103T190000Z", "UID": "919e8b3c65ba7cee25477d0487d32277952023_11:49:44_AM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Data Analysis with Stata", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935763", "DESCRIPTION": "Are you new to data analysis and/or Stata?

The resistance of this famous German author is both inspiring and, alas, deeply relevant today, as we witness the fundamental values of democracy once again being called into question by a increasingly virulent populism and nationalism on both sides of the Atlantic that are putting democratic society under massive pressure.. . . . As a polemical contribution to these current debates, the Princeton German Department is hosting the touring exhibition Thomas Mann: Democracy Will Win! whose spatial and metaphorical center is the Thomas Mann House in Pacific Palisades, California. For it was from this sanctuary in exile that Mann campaigned tirelessly for a new understanding of democracy. Today Mann\u2019s West Coast residence is once again at the service of intellectual exchange and transatlantic understanding.. . . . The first part of the exhibition presents the development of Thomas Mann\u2019s political biography from monarchist to powerful opponent of National Socialism and committed fighter for democracy. Photographs, texts, excerpts from the famous radio addresses \u201cTo the German Listeners!\u201d and original exhibits trace his intellectual, political and spatial paths.. . . . The second multimedia section connects this history to the present. What makes a political person? How does one become a supporter of democracy? How does one defend one\u2019s stance? Film clips and interviews, tweets and quotes from personalities from politics, popular culture, literature and society  \u2013 ranging from Greta Thunberg to Sa\u0161a Stani\u0161i\u0107, from Donald Trump to Barack Obama, from Igor Levit to Edward Snowden \u2013 illustrate the importance of the question: How can we defend and sustainably strengthen democracy as a responsible model of social organisation? This is a task that is more important than ever today, in times of rampant neo-fascisms, global migration, climate change, and new pandemics.. . . . The exhibition is structured around the terms Beginnings, Zeitgeist, Affirmation, Take Action, and Responsibility which convey some of the ambivalences that even a democratic system cannot eliminate.

Excessive national overconfidence has both domestic and international consequences, but it has rarely been studied. A survey conducted in 2020 and a pre-registered two-wave survey experiment in 2021 shows that the Chinese public overwhelmingly overestimates China's global reputation and soft power, even during a national crisis. Importantly, informing Chinese citizens of China's actual international image can effectively and significantly correct their factual perceptions of the country's global reputation. It also moderately lowers their evaluations of China and its governing system and their expectations for the country's external success. These effects from simple information interventions are not fleeting, and they indicate that triumphalism and overconfidence can be meaningfully mitigated. The findings are not only of theoretical interest but have significant policy implications.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936042"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081555", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231113T170748", "CREATED": "20231005T120000", "SEQUENCE": "14", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Safe Princeton Fieldwork\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/SPF/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/SPF/rsvp_boot?id=1937507#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "SPF", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Training/Workshop", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Skill-Building,Wellness & Community", "DTSTART": "20231113T213000Z", "DTEND": "20231113T230000Z", "UID": "ed49c824f167681a4b3312c72fb242221052023_11:52:20_AM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "SPF: First Aid Kit Making for Fieldwork", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937507", "DESCRIPTION": "Are you going into the field this winter or spring?

Although her translations were later subject to scrutiny and concerns about accuracy, this talk will demonstrate that Garnett was the translator who brought Russian literature to the modernists and whose translations played a key role in the transition away from Victorian letters. This talk will explore Garnett\u2019s signature move as a translator: the co-creation of charismatic and manic characters who speak with the same voice across her translations of work by separate authors. The talk will involve reparative work on Garnett\u2019s translations, which are questionable according to translational norms of both yesterday and today, but function well as modernist translations, following the distinctly modernist calibration of equivalence.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937151"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081556", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231115T124006", "CREATED": "20231101T120000", "SEQUENCE": "3", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Princeton Bioethics Exchange\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/bioethics/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/bioethics/rsvp_boot?id=1938252#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "BIOETHICS", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Student Organization Event", "DTSTART": "20231116T170000Z", "DTEND": "20231116T183000Z", "UID": "36ad96ae6444b0eddc8221ed6d467f7c1112023_10:37:23_AM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "PBE7 : The Ethics of Selective Mandatory Vaccination", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938252", "DESCRIPTION": "A lunch discussion on The Ethics of Selective Mandatory Vaccination\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938252"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081556", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231109T163742", "CREATED": "20231109T120000", "SEQUENCE": "1", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Princeton University Library\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/PULIB/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/PULIB/rsvp_boot?id=1938669#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PULIB", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Training/Workshop", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Arts,GradFUTURES Learning Cohort,Undergraduate Research,Wellness & Community", "DTSTART": "20231116T170000Z", "DTEND": "20231116T200000Z", "UID": "92a5c4d61a902d1d4e361e7a750d80cc1192023_4:34:26_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Mobile Makerspace! at Cotsen Children's Library", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938669", "DESCRIPTION": "The PUL Makerspace is traveling!

Higher education in the East African Countries of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda was a creation of the British colonial government right from the 1920s when Makerere College was established as a tertiary institution that trained a few East and Central African students to prepare them to take jobs in support of the economic growth of the United Kingdom. . . . . In this presentation, Chacha Nyaigotti Chacha will seek to demonstrate that since independence in the '60s, higher education in East Africa has experienced an exponential growth of Universities and other tertiary institutions. He will trace this transformation while underscoring how the development of higher education in East Africa contributed to the struggle for freedom and independence from colonial bondage and highlight how the curriculum has evolved allowing both the learners and the lecturers to engage in introspection as they go on to decolonize their minds and culture. He will demonstrate that during the colonial period, the driving force behind the development of education in general and higher education, in particular, was to ensure that there would be an adequate supply of a trained human capital that could be deployed in a strategic economic undertaking whose proceeds would be repatriated to the home country of the colonizers. He will also discuss the question of the curriculum, language, and culture in an attempt to indicate that the use of English in the three countries continues to be a pertinent question that scholars are debating to date.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936477"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081556", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231113T082952", "CREATED": "20230921T120000", "SEQUENCE": "9", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Program in Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/PIIRSREEES/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/PIIRSREEES/rsvp_boot?id=1936942#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PIIRSREEES", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Meeting", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Global/Intercultural", "DTSTART": "20231116T213000Z", "DTEND": "20231116T230000Z", "UID": "81c7d9cbd930b384b525ea38081ce33a9212023_10:21:52_AM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "In Search of an Own 'Self': Anticolonial Discourse of Soviet Ukrainian Cinema in the 1920s.", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936942", "DESCRIPTION": "Join REEES' Kruzhok Meeting: Yana Prymachenko (History), \"In Search of an Own 'Self': Anticolonial Discourse of Soviet Ukrainian Cinema in the 1920s.\" . . . .

Davis follows forensic archaeologists and anthropologists who attempt to locate, identify, and return to relatives the remains of Cypriots killed in those conflicts. She turns to filmmakers who use archival photographs and footage to come to terms with political violence and its legacies. In both forensic science and documentary filmmaking, the dynamics of secrecy and revelation shape how material remains such as bones and archival images are given meaning. Throughout, Davis demonstrates how Cypriots navigate the tension between an ethics of knowledge, which valorizes truth as a prerequisite for recovery and reconciliation, and the politics of knowledge, which renders evidence as irremediably partial and perpetually falsifiable.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935027"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T074125", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231125T203159", "CREATED": "20230907T120000", "SEQUENCE": "7", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Bloom": " A Graduate Wellness Collective\":https://my.princeton.edu/bloom/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/bloom/rsvp_boot?id=1935951#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "BLOOM", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Student Organization Event", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Diversity & Inclusion,Mentorship,Self-care,Wellness & Community,Personal Well-being & Effectiveness", "DTSTART": "20231128T214500Z", "DTEND": "20231128T230000Z", "UID": "ee06f23711e8f72a47387af19c8795b9972023_4:44:28_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "BLOOM: Managing Financial Anxiety Featuring Aja Evans, LMHC ", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935951", "DESCRIPTION": "What money stories do you tell yourself, and how do they influence your holistic health?

As researchers, we can apply a few basic principles of modern software development to our scientific software development process, both to mitigate the risk of such failures and to save time.. . . . One popular method, referred to as Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD), involves pushing software changes to a shared repository often in order to avoid the issues that result from individual versions of code diverging over time. This talk introduces a simple and tested workflow for scientific software development that relies on Git along with GitHub Actions which is the automatic testing framework from GitHub.. . . . Workshop format: Presentation and hands-on. . . . Target audience: This talk is intended for a wide research audience. Some knowledge of Git fundamental concepts is required . Through examples, it will introduce a workflow based on basic concepts of Git, testing, and automatic testing. There will be a hands-on exercise using GitHub Actions.. . . . Knowledge prerequisites: Prior experience with version control using Git and Github will be necessary to follow the workshop.

Learning objectives: Attendees will leave with a clear idea of what can be done with CI and automated testing tools, and, hopefully, some motivation to do it.  Participants will also be armed with concrete information on how to set up Github and GitHub Actions to implement the workflow introduced in the talk for their own software development at Princeton.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935890"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081600", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231121T084054", "CREATED": "20230908T120000", "SEQUENCE": "3", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Princeton Institute for International & Regional Studies\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/PIIRS/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/PIIRS/rsvp_boot?id=1936025#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PIIRS", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Forum/Panel Discussion", "DTSTART": "20231130T170000Z", "DTEND": "20231130T183000Z", "UID": "4989197b8e778fb65e52d9f5ef7eb2bc982023_12:59:13_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Politics and Information-Digital Technologies: Debating Peril and Promise", "LOCATION": "Louis A.

This program of six videos was commissioned by Visual AIDS to generate connections between HIV and other forms of illness and disability. Introduced by Art Museum Director James Steward. . . . . This screening is free and open to the public. Reserve your free ticket on the Princeton Garden Theatre\u2019s website.  . . . . Inspired by a statement from Cyr\u00e9e Jarelle Johnson in the book Black Futures, Everyone I Know Is Sick examines how our society excludes disabled and sick people by upholding a false dichotomy of health and sickness. Inviting us to understand disability as a common experience rather than an exception to the norm, the program highlights a range of experiences spanning HIV, COVID-19, mental health, and aging. The commissioned artists foreground the knowledge and expertise of disabled and sick people in a world still grappling with multiple ongoing pandemics. . . . . https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/calendar/2023-12/day-without-art-film-screening-everyone-i-know-sick. . . .

Durable, reproducible, and aesthetically versatile, these objects were the result of hours of intense, messy, and risky labor in the foundry, working with temperatures high enough to fuse liquid metal into bronze. The sixteenth century metallurgist, Vannoccio Biringuccio, once described the foundry as both an Inferno and a Paradise, so chaotic and dangerous but \u201cin which sparkled all the beauty of genius and the power of art.\u201d Straddling science, art, and engineering, casting is characterized by its very interdisciplinarity, and this workshop aims to introduce participants across fields and specialties firsthand to the complex art of modeling, casting, and finishing bronze. In this workshop, we invite participants into the foundry of Biringuccio \u2013 real and imagined \u2013 in a two-day bronze casting event at the Seward Johnson Atelier in Trenton, NJ, an industrial studio specializing in the fabrication, conservation, and treatment of metal sculpture. Participants will design, carve, and cast their own two-part sand mold, for which materials, tools, and instructions will be provided by skilled practitioners of the Atelier. Together students will learn the general processes of casting and take part in the sculpting, mold making, and bronze pour of their designs (Day 1), before applying a variety of hot and cold patinas to protect and color their castings (Day 2). We are excited to introduce more Princeton students and scholars to the Atelier\u2019s technical resources and hope to inspire future collaborations.. . . . Participants must sign up for Cast in Bronze Parts 1 and 2.. . . . Meet the Facilitator:. .
