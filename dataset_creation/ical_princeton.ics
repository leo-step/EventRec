SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Global Geographies of Weather Modification in an Era of Climate Change
LOCATION:Louis A Simpson International Building, Room 144, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934438
DESCRIPTION:As climate change impacts intensify, the practice of cloud seeding to induce precipitation and otherwise modify the weather is on the rise around the world. In 2018, for example, seven states in the western United States entered into the Colorado River Basin Weather Modification Agreement to try to augment snowpack. In response to unprecedented drought on the Yangtze River in summer 2022, the Chinese government stepped up its already extensive weather modification efforts. Moreover, intensified weather modification efforts have contributed to geopolitical tensions. Weather modification is also associated in the public imagination with solar radiation management, a highly controversial form of geoengineering. Despite the importance of weather modification in the context of climate change, it has not attracted much attention from geographers. Through the lens of several geographical concepts, Emily Yeh, professor of geography at University of Colorado-Boulder, considers practices of weather modification in the U.S., China, and the United Arab Emirates. These include China’s “Sky River” project that promised to seed clouds to move rain across the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nMeeting Link: https://princeton.zoom.us/j/92266282481\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934438

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Ecological States: A Book Talk with Jesse Rodenbiker, Mi Shih, Emily Yeh, and Jerry Zee
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934446
DESCRIPTION:"Ecological States" critically examines ecological policies in the People's Republic of China to show how campaigns of scientifically based environmental protection transform nature and society. While many point to China's ecological civilization programs as a new paradigm for global environmental governance, Jesse Rodenbiker argues that ecological redlining extends the reach of the authoritarian state. Although Chinese urban sustainability initiatives have driven millions of citizens from their land and housing, Rodenbiker shows that these migrants are not passive subjects of state policy. Instead, they creatively navigate resettlement processes in pursuit of their own benefit. However, their resistance is limited by varied forms of state-backed infrastructural violence. Through extensive fieldwork with scientists, urban planners, and everyday citizens in southwestern China, "Ecological States" exposes the ways in which the scientific logics and practices fundamental to China's green urbanization have solidified state power and contributed to dispossession and social inequality.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934446

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935022
DESCRIPTION:Ryo Morimoto's book celebration of the release of Nuclear Ghost: Atomic Livelihoods in Fukushima's Gray Zone (April 2023). . . . In conversation with:. . . . Adriana Petryna. . University of Pennsylvania. . Professor of Anthropology; Director, MD-PhD Program in Anthropology. . . . Anne McClintock. . Princeton University. . A. Barton Hepburn Professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies and the High Meadows Environmental Institute. . . . Tae Cimarosti. . Princeton University. . Anthropology Graduate Student. . . . Ryo Morimoto is a first-generation student and scholar from Japan. His scholarly work addresses the planetary impacts of our past and present engagements with nuclear things. Regionally centered on Japan, Morimoto’s research creates spaces, languages, and archives through which to think about nuclear things, along with other not immediately sensible contaminants, as part of what it means to live in the late industrial and postfallout era. He grounds his work in a range of theoretical frameworks—including semiotic anthropology, anthropology of disaster, environmental anthropology, anthropology and the recent history of Japan, anthropology of science and technology, and digital humanities. Morimoto mobilizes them to explore the uses and applications of technologies in social processes whereby certain sensory-cognitive experiences are (im)materialized and to grapple with the techno-sensory politics that emerge in discourses concerning invisible things. His scholarship addresses the experiences of lay public to read situated perspectives against the archive of what has been rendered perceptible.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935022

DESCRIPTION:Are you eager to develop a community of writers and feel motivated to write? Are you looking for the incentive to write regularly, and to practice communicating your ideas to supportive readers outside your discipline?. . . . Join us this Fall through the McGraw Center to participate in small, robust, interdisciplinary writing groups of post-Generals grad students. Beginning with a virtual launch on Fri 9/15/23 from 12-1pm, the groups will convene weekly online for approximately 12 weeks (through mid-Dec) to give and receive support for the writing process, and possibly to workshop writing. The goal is to offer supportive environments for grad students to clarify and develop writing projects, increase motivation and create accountability, and also foster connections to combat the loneliness and isolation that can accompany writing.. . . . This is a wonderful opportunity to form a writing community, meet your writing goals, and potentially develop skills to give and receive feedback.. . . . To commit to joining a group, please complete the following Interest form: https://forms.gle/1NUU4ChXe1BUQexD8\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935000

DESCRIPTION:Korean Graduate Student Association (KGSA) plans to hold an orientation session with a welcoming reception for incoming and current graduate students and post-docs. Especially, most incoming students who join KGSA are from South Korea and come to the United States for the first time. Therefore, we wish that our orientation session can be a good opportunity to network with current students and to get practical helps about Princeton life (places to visit in Princeton, bank/phone, transportations, etc). Along with the orientation, we are planning to throw a welcoming party to celebrate the Korean national holiday 'Chuseok' with Korean traditional food and drinks. Our ultimate goal for this event is to help all KGSA members build a strong community and let them know our community is here to reach when they need any help.. . . . Based on our experience in the last in-person event, we expect to have 50+ attendees at this event.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935329

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934184
DESCRIPTION:QGIS has an excellent interface for exploring and analyzing spatial information. Point, line, and area features (vector data) are both geographic objects on a map and records in a table. Such features can be selected by location or by the values stored in each feature’s record. These simple capabilities allow the GIS user to conduct complex analyses. We will use data for central New Jersey to calculate the area of land use types near streams, the extent of paved surfaces, and other measures.  Attendees will use QGIS on classroom Windows computers.. . . . This event is part of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) workshop series. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934184

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location

DESCRIPTION:Are you interested in and good at lots of different things? Do you like to get involved in multiple activities? And do you tend to say “yes” whenever someone asks you to do something, or an opportunity presents itself? Being involved, engaged, and open to new experiences can be wonderful, but sometimes the tendency to say “yes” leads to taking on too much and feeling overwhelmed. In this workshop open to all graduate students and postdocs, we will explore and practice strategies for how, when, and whether to say “yes” to taking on tasks, as well as how to artfully relinquish responsibilities that are no longer fulfilling.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935002

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Sounds in Wax: Musicology, Linguistics, and the World as a Resource
LOCATION:East Pyne 205, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1933852
DESCRIPTION:This lecture focuses on the Berlin Phonogramm-Archiv, founded in 1900, and its subsequent strategy of collecting languages and music from a potentially wide range of world regions. But at the time, members of the archive managed to embrace the world as a resource in yet another respect: the daily production of cylinder records required large quantities of wax and various other materials that depended on a global system of material supply—including Brazilian carnauba wax and montan wax from German lignite mines, the extraction of which caused environmental damage and deprived local populations of their livelihoods. As I show, this use of material resources resonated in many ways with the agenda for the study of cultural resources developed at the Phonogramm-Archiv during the eras of the German Empire, World War I, German colonialism, and the Weimar Republic. In addition, the production of the wax cylinders provided members of the archive with extensive knowledge of materials science and chemistry, which in turn influenced their methods of analyzing and understanding language and music.. . . . Cosponsored by the Music Department \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1933852

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:How Much Has China’s Hukou Reform Achieved Since 2014?
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room A71 , Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935465
DESCRIPTION:China's emergence as a prominent global manufacturing player is intricately tied to its vast army of internal migrant labor and its strategy of "incomplete urbanization" over the past four decades. The huge pool of low-cost migrant labor has significantly bolstered the competitiveness of Chinese manufactured goods in the international market. Nonetheless, due to their lack of local household registration (hukou), these laborers cannot access various urban social benefits, leading to the separation of tens of millions of migrant families across different areas and giving rise to a host of challenges. In 2014, China inaugurated its New-type Urbanization Plan and undertook measures to reform the hukou system, committing to lower the proportion of the "migrant" population by 2020 and increasing migrant children's enrollment in schools. Drawing from 2020 Census data and recent policy documentation, this presentation offers an initial assessment of the main outcomes stemming from the 2014 plan, discusses the persisting obstacles China confronts in integrating the migrant population and the latest national and local endeavors to reform the hukou system.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935465

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:The Constitution and the Court
LOCATION:Robertson Hall, Bowl 016, Princeton, NJ 08544, United States
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936513
DESCRIPTION:Constitution Day Lecture 2023. . . . The idea that the Constitution means whatever the Supreme Court says it means is, in important respects, hard-wired in the contemporary American psyche.  It did not have to be this way.  Indeed, a fair measure of constitutional scholarship over the past two centuries has been occupied by professorial debates over whether or not it should.  Today, for the first time in more than half a century, a deeply controversial Court has led a fair measure of Americans to begin asking the same question. But the reasons for the Court’s plummeting status in broad polls of public confidence – the reasons why a growing number of Americans now question its legitimacy – could be many.  Which if any of those reasons might justify the conviction that it is time to rethink the Court’s effective monopoly on constitutional meaning? The answer depends on what we think a court’s job is – what a judge’s or even a lawyer’s job is – in the first place. It depends on what we can reasonably expect of the rule of law, and of the Constitution as a part of it.. . . . Deborah Pearlstein is director of Princeton's new Program in Law and Public Policy and is the Charles and Marie Robertson Visiting Professor in Law and Public Affairs. She is currently Professor of Law and Co-director of the Floersheimer Center for Constitutional Democracy at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, and teaches a course each year in law and public policy.. . . . Deborah holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School. After earning her law degree, she clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens of the U.S. Supreme Court, worked in private practice, and served as the founding director of the Law and Security Program at Human Rights First. Following her departure from practice, Deborah was appointed a research scholar in law and public affairs at SPIA, a position she held for four years, until joining Cardozo Law as an assistant professor of law in 2011. Her work on the U.S. Constitution, international law, and national security has appeared widely in law journals and the popular press, where she is quoted often as an expert source, and has repeatedly been the subject of her testimony before Congress. Before entering law school, she served as senior editor and speechwriter in the White House to President Clinton. Today, she serves on the U.S. State Department Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, focused on ensuring the timely declassification and publication of government records surrounding major events in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nMeeting Link: https://lectures.princeton.edu/lectures/2023/constitution-and-court\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936513

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Transhemispheric Translation:  Scenes from Contemporary Latin American Poetics
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936490
DESCRIPTION:This talk is organized around case studies of "transhemispheric translation," a term employed to describe poetic experiments that fundamentally foreground translation-between Spanish and English, Latin America and the United States-for the purpose of negotiating hemispheric power differentials.  Beginning in the context of the inter-American Cold War of the late 1960s and early 1970s, this talk demonstrates that translation operated as a space of Cold War power.  This context allow for a re-reading of Cold War poetic performances of inter-American contact: the Argentine poet Juan Gelman's 1969 pseudotranslation of a fake US poet and the Chilean multimedia artist Cecilia Vicuña's 1973 "untranslation" into English.  The talk ends by considering a recent example-non-equivalent self-translations by the Puerto Rican poet Urayoán Noel-to consider how transhemispheric translation continues to function in anti-imperialist fashion today. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936490

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Entrepreneurship, Venture Capital, and Startups Learning Cohort: Starting with “Who Cares?” and “So What?”
LOCATION:Julis Romo Rabinowitz A97, Julis Romo Rabinowitz A97, Princeton, NJ 08544, United States
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934973
DESCRIPTION:A growing number of startups are emerging from universities and research institutes — young enterprises that are accelerating innovation and changing the game in social entrepreneurship and in every field imaginable. Increasingly, graduate students are the founders or co-founders behind these new businesses.At Princeton, there is a robust innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem that connects graduate students, postdocs, alumni, faculty, venture capitalists, and industry.. . . . During the course of 8 weeks, this program serves as a “crash course” for understanding the world of entrepreneurship, VC funding and startups. You will learn about the lingo, the economics, the process, and the landscape—and meet members of the broader innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. You will also hear first-hand from graduate alumni founders about their entrepreneurial journeys -- and all of the challenges and successes they had along the way. The cohort culminates with a group project where graduate students will work across disciplines to synthesize and apply their learnings.. . . . Cohort sessions are led by Princeton alums Jim Cohen ’86 and Mark Poag ’93, general partners of Fitz Gate Ventures. Fitz Gate Ventures is an early stage, network-driven venture capital firm.. . . . For the first time this year, the cohort will include two guest lectures taught by Christina Pellicane, Assistant Director of Innovation at Princeton and Lead Instructor, NSF I-Corps Northeast Hub.. . . . By participating in this cohort, you will see why the Venture Capital and Startups Learning Cohort has become one of GradFUTURES’ most popular offerings and why Jim and Mark were each awarded the Clio Award from the Princeton Grad School for the value this cohort has brought to Princeton graduate students over the years.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934973

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Finding the Best Location using QGIS
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934186
DESCRIPTION:GIS (geographic information system) software allows the user to treat the Earth’s surface as a continuous array of numbers. Images and raster datasets can be used to rank suitable locations, estimate change, and display phenomena such as elevation, precipitation, or temperature. The session uses percent impervious surface, distance from streams, and slope to assign each parameter a scale from 1 to 9, and weight the relative suitability of different areas. This ‘weighted overlay’ method is useful in a variety of contexts. The QGIS Python console and editor will be used to help build a Python script to process data. Attendees will use QGIS installed on classroom computers.. . . . This event is part of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) workshop series. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934186

DESCRIPTION:Instructor: R. Edward Freeman, Elis and Signe Olsson Professor of Business Administration, UVA Darden School of Business.. . . . In this session, we will explore how 21st Century businesses have adopted the idea that the purpose of business can be greater than just making profits.

DESCRIPTION:In 21st century research libraries, multiple units are often producing and engaging with 3D data. This includes a growing number of standalone scanning, visualization, and 3D printing facilities operating independently on digital objects-of-study whose “primary dimension are spatial” or can be interpreted spatially. The talk is intended as a survey of these interrelated – but oftentimes administratively disparate – methods. Attendees will hear case studies and specific tool recommendations, positioned throughout this “lifecycle,” the combination of which can be deployed to ensure the scholarly rigor of 3D contents.. . . . Matt Cook is Digital Scholarship Program Manager at Harvard Library. In this role, Matt provides instruction, assists in the development of technology spaces, and leads efforts to digitize and explore heterogenous (i.e. text, artifacts, AV, etc.) material collections, at scale, while keeping “humans in the loop” through the use of augmented and virtual reality interfaces. As a researcher, Matt studies the state and trajectory of digital scholarship generally, what it takes to manage exploratory teams in libraries, and the scholarly impact of new knowledge services related to physical fabrication and mindfulness.

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934187
DESCRIPTION:GIS software allows the user to treat the Earth’s surface as a continuous array of numbers. Images and raster datasets can be used to rank suitable locations, estimate change, and display phenomena such as elevation, precipitation, or temperature. The session uses percent impervious surface, distance from streams, and slope to assign each parameter a scale from 1 to 9, and weight the relative suitability of different areas. ArcGIS Pro’s built-in Jupyter notebook will be used to process the data for analysis. This ‘weighted overlay’ method is useful in a variety of contexts. Students will use ArcGIS Pro installed on the classroom’s Windows computers.. . . . This event is part of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) workshops series. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934187

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Postdoctoral Talk: Sensory Life in South India: Counter-Narratives of Islamic Material Culture
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935848
DESCRIPTION:The Islamic built environment in India is under tremendous strain today. Mosques, especially, are disparaged as “ocular reminders” of India’s Muslim past. In this context, how can we understand the range of significations that such sites have for ordinary Muslims? This talk focuses on mosques on the southeastern coast of India, built in a distinctive style that is rooted in local architectural idioms. Such mosques are an integral part of the Tamil sacred landscape, indexing the region’s longstanding Muslim presence as well as histories of maritime trade and mobility. The presentation explores how the architecture and materiality of the built environment mediate people's connection to the past, and how such sites are reimagined as spaces of heritage, historical consciousness, and cultural value. . . . . Part of the The Chadha Center for Global India's series on Power, Inequality, Dissent Event: 2023-2024. . . .

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Negotiating Just and Equal Cities
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room B60, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937053
DESCRIPTION:In this talk, Aditya Kumar will draw on his personal experiences in post-disaster reconstruction in rural villages in India, complex urban development in the US, people-centred reconstruction in post-war Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, and in shaping pro-poor urban policies in post apartheid South Africa. By interlacing these seemingly disparate, extreme and provocative experiences, he will shed light on the failure of the state, large international agencies and more generally, the private property market system. This failure to address land rights and adequate housing has polarized many cities across those that own private property, and those that are landless and homeless.  Amidst this visible tension, he will draw on everyday struggles for land and housing forced by social movements and community networks that are forcing a new reality in urban areas across the world. Ultimately, through these experiences, he will illustrate some of the empirical practices and tactics of co-production, negotiation, resistance and protest in developing policies for just and equal cities.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937053

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Embodied Minds in the Late Capitalist System: Suicide and Environmental Degradation in Africa
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room 144, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936448
DESCRIPTION:This talk by Julie Livingston, the Julius Silver Professor at New York University,  limns the landscape of suicide in Africa, but also here in the U.S., as a means to contemplate the deadly and escalating psychic toll of the current environmental predicament. It asks how climate change — a welter of incremental, corrosive shifts layered with sudden catastrophic events generated and perpetuated through industrial systems of profit — can get under the skin and into the human psyche.  \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936448

DESCRIPTION:How can we grade both fairly and efficiently? How can we provide feedback that students will reflect on and use to improve their work? This workshop addresses important concerns and challenges of grading—including the question of how to grade student participation. Participants in the workshop will define the criteria for their students’ work and begin to formulate rubrics that can usefully address these concerns as well as meaningfully assess and advance their students’ learning. Further, we consider how we might shift our students’ focus on getting good grades to reflecting on their own learning.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935018

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:How to Understand China's Economy
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936041
DESCRIPTION:As China's economy shifts from high-speed growth to a medium-to-high-speed growth stage, maintaining an economic growth rate of around 5% has become a more frequently anchored goal when China plans its economic work and formulates macro policies. At the same time, pessimism in discussions about China's economic prospects gradually emerged and began to pervade mainstream media. "Is China's economic miracle over?" has become an important issue of global concern.. . . . In Liu Qiao's view, the realization of China's economic miracle over the past four decades has benefited from productivity growth in the process of industrialization and the "government and market" growth paradigm. In the future, the biggest challenge for China's economic and social development is to maintain the growth rate of total factor productivity. What is cause for optimism is that the driving force for China's continued productivity growth is real.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936041

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Disability, Embodiment, and the Limits of Knowledge: Religion and the Public Conversation with Sarah Imhoff
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937141
DESCRIPTION:Sarah Imhoff is Professor of Religious Studies and the Borns Jewish Studies Program at Indiana University Bloomington. She is the author most recently of The Lives of Jessie Sampter: Queer, Disabled, Zionist, which tells the story of an individual full of contradictions. Jessie Sampter (1883–1938) was best known for her Course in Zionism (1915), an American primer for understanding support of a Jewish state in Palestine. In 1919, Sampter packed a trousseau, declared herself “married to Palestine,” and immigrated there. Yet Sampter’s own life and body hardly matched typical Zionist ideals. Although she identified with Judaism, Sampter took up and experimented with spiritual practices from various religions. While Zionism celebrated the strong and healthy body, she spoke of herself as “crippled” from polio and plagued by sickness her whole life. While Zionism applauded reproductive women’s bodies, Sampter never married or bore children; in fact, she wrote of homoerotic longings and had same-sex relationships. By charting how Sampter’s life did not neatly line up with her own religious and political ideals, Imhoff highlights the complicated and at times conflicting connections between the body, queerness, disability, religion, and nationalism.. . . . Prof. Imhoff will be interviewed by CCSR Post-doctoral Fellow Lauren K. McCormick.. . . . The 2023-2024 theme for the Religion and the Public Conversation series is "Bodies and Embodiment." . . . . This event is free and open to the public. If you cannot attend in person, register to watch the livestream webinar. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937141

Join us for a social hour to discuss the exciting field of quantum computing. The discussion will be led by physicist Benjamin Lienhard who is a quantum computing practitioner. Food will be served at the very beginning of the event. Registration is required.. . . . Quantum computers are anticipated to solve particular computational tasks, from factoring to molecular simulations, substantially faster than conventional computers. Depending on the task, such quantum computers need to be composed of hundreds to millions of quantum bits, the principal building blocks of a quantum processor. Present-day quantum processors comprise tens of qubits and are not yet able to execute any meaningful computations due to, among others, a lack of scalable and precise calibration and control techniques. In this workshop, I will introduce you to the theoretical concepts of quantum computing and discuss the challenges of realizing a useful quantum computer.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935498

DESCRIPTION:Highlight Seminar Series – with speaker Monica Contestabile of Nature Sustainability – The seminar will cover why interdisciplinary, cross-domain, multisector, and integrated systems thinking are all needed approaches to address the most pressing sustainability challenges society is facing; it will also cover the extent to which the education and research communities, funding agencies, and the publishing landscape are transforming their visions, priorities, and practices to respond adequately.  The seminar will then go through the inherent challenges and advantages of going beyond conventional disciplinary research, including from the point of view of publishing such more complex research outputs. It will consist of examples of editorial practices adopted at Nature Sustainability to promote inter-disciplinarity and trans-disciplinarity followed by questions and answers and a general discussion.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937163

DESCRIPTION:In this presentation, Zai Liang reports findings from a recent project on international migration in China using multiple sources (Chinese Population Censuses, Surveys, and Fieldwork). He reviews the larger contexts of China that are conducive for international migration, which include rising economy prosperity, “One Belt and One Road Initiative," and China’s attempt to become a leader for international higher education.  Liang summarizes three of recent studies by my research team: one focusing on religion and international migration, another on a new global neighborhood in China, and the third one on broad temporal and spatial patterns of international migrants in China. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935781

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Business Skills for PhDs in Academia and Beyond: Negotiation in Organizations 
LOCATION:Online Event
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934915
DESCRIPTION:Instructor: Roshni Raveendhran, Assistant Professor of Business Administration, UVA Darden School of Business. . . . We negotiate every day—with merchants, service providers, employers, coworkers, friends, and family—determining what price we will pay, the amount of our salary and compensation, what movies to watch, where to go to dinner, who will clean the kitchen, and so forth. Although negotiations are a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives, many of us know little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way, while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire?   . . . . The session is designed to address a broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by managers and professionals. It will provide you with the opportunity to develop your negotiation skills experientially through role-playing exercises. Specifically, we will examine the following: . . . . Basic negotiation concepts . . . . Key strategies for effective negotiations . . . . Overcoming psychological resistance and other barriers to accomplishing superior negotiation outcomes . . . . . . Cohort Description: Most people associate the term “business” with the private sector. However, business skills and models are widely applied in every sector: public, private and non-profit (which includes academia). You are acquiring many transferable skills in your Ph.D. program that can be applied in academic roles as well as within a variety of industries and job functions. Join the business skills learning cohort to better understand foundational concepts and language of business. This learning cohort includes experiential learning in the form of group capstone presentations under guidance of alum mentors. . . . . . . . . Broad Topics include:. . . . Purpose, ethics, and responsibility: stakeholder theory. . . . Analysis of strategy and operations . . . . Data science in business. . . . Leadership and mentoring. . . . Negotiation. . . . Financial 360. . . . Business Communications. . . . Business of higher ed. . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934915

About the WCAPH: Initiated during the 2022-23 academic year, this cohort meets with a diverse range of figures working at cultural institutions, both on and off-campus, to explore the reciprocal relationships between performance and research, criticism and production, theory and practice, and administration and academia, while learning about career paths in the public humanities, theater, arts, and GLAMS (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). Last year, this included trips to museums, theaters, historical societies, and more in Washington DC and New York City, as well as extended engagement with Princeton’s own McCarter Theater.. . . . How to Arrive: Enter through the McCarter Theater’s glass administration doors across from the Dinky Bar (which are just slightly uphill from the Matthews/Berlin theater entrance). Once inside, there will be signs directing visitors to the Presidents’ Lounge, where we will have our meeting.. . . . Questions? Please reach out to Dylan Blau Edelstein: dylane@princeton.edu\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937287

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Zelensky Effect
LOCATION:Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building, Room A17, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936771
DESCRIPTION:With Russian shells raining on Kyiv and tanks closing in, American forces prepared to evacuate Ukraine's leader. Just three years earlier, his apparent main qualification had been playing a president on TV. But Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly retorted, "I need ammunition, not a ride." Ukrainian forces won the battle for Kyiv, ensuring their country's independence even as a longer war began for the southeast.. . . . You cannot understand the historic events of 2022 without understanding Zelensky. But the Zelensky effect is less about the man himself than about the civic nation he embodies: what makes Zelensky most extraordinary in war is his very ordinariness as a Ukrainian.. . . . "The Zelensky Effect" explains this paradox, exploring Ukraine's national history to show how its now-iconic president reflects the hopes and frustrations of the country's first "independence generation." Interweaving social and political background with compelling episodes from Zelensky's life and career, this is the story of Ukraine told through the journey of one man who has come to symbolize his country.. . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936771

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937142
DESCRIPTION:A conversation with Diane Winston, author of Righting the American Dream: How the Media Mainstreamed Reagan's Evangelical Vision, a provocative new history of how the news media facilitated the Reagan Revolution and the rise of the religious Right.. .  . . After two years in the White House, an aging and increasingly unpopular Ronald Reagan looked like a one-term president, but in 1983 something changed. Reagan spoke of his embattled agenda as a spiritual rather than a political project and cast his vision for limited government and market economics as the natural outworking of religious conviction. The news media broadcast this message with enthusiasm, and white evangelicals rallied to the president’s cause. With their support, Reagan won reelection and continued to dismantle the welfare state, unraveling a political consensus that stood for half a century. In Righting the American Dream, Diane Winston reveals how support for Reagan emerged from a new religious vision of American identity circulating in the popular press. Through four key events—the “evil empire” speech, AIDS outbreak, invasion of Grenada, and rise in American poverty rates—Winston shows that many journalists uncritically adopted Reagan’s religious rhetoric and ultimately mainstreamed otherwise unpopular evangelical ideas about individual responsibility. The result is a provocative new account of how Reagan together with the press turned America to the right and initiated a social revolution that continues today.. . . . Winston will be in conversation with CCSR Graduate Student Fellow Rachel Brown-Weinstock. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937142

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936539
DESCRIPTION:Research papers and protocol organization in labs often lack detailed instructions for repeating experiments. Princeton University Library has a instutional membership to protocols.io, an open-access platform for researchers to collaboratively create step-by-step, interactive, and dynamic protocols that can be run on mobile or web. Researchers can share protocols with colleagues, collaborators, the scientific community or make them public, with ease and efficiency. Real-time communication and interaction keep protocols up to date with versioning, forking/copying, Q&A, and troubleshooting. Public protocols receive a DOI (digital object identifier) and allow open communication with authors and researchers to encourage efficient experimentation and reproducibility.. . . . This 45-minute workshop will cover:. . . . Introduction to protocols.io’s mission and key functionality. . . . How to discover public protocols, create your own protocols, share methods with others, and how to publish protocols. . . . Q&A: We will stay online to answer any questions you have while you start to use protocols.io.. . . . Hosted by Gabriel Gasque, protocols.io. . . . To register: https://www.protocols.io/webinars/introduction5. . . . Princeton University students, faculty, and staff now have access to free premium accounts on protocols.io, an open-access repository of step-by-step, detailed protocols and methods for researchers across multiple disciplines, particularly those in the sciences and engineering.. . . . Protocols.io allows Princeton researchers to create, manage, and share their research protocols and methods with other users on the platform, making them freely available for other scholars and improving reproducibility across the field. Users may also choose to keep their research private.. . . . Related LibGuide: Protocols.io by Meghan Testerman\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936539

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Can Digital Innovation Advance Social Equity for Marginalized Groups?
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936524
DESCRIPTION:This talk will begin with broadly discussing opportunities and concerns in the deployment and goveranace of information and communication technologies to advance social equity focusing on India's digital stack (biometric ID and direct bank payment transfers). The second part of the talk will focus on community-based research in Andhrapradesh from the book, "Patching Development: Information Politics and Social Change in India," which asks the following key question: How can development programs deliver benefits to marginalized citizens in ways that expand their rights and freedoms? Political will and good policy design are critical but often insufficient due to resistance from entrenched local power systems. The book introduces the concept of "patching development" as a top-down, fine-grained, iterative socio-technical process that makes local information about implementation visible through technology and enlists participation from marginalized citizens through social audits. These processes are neither neat nor orderly and have led to a contentious sphere where the exercise of power over documents, institutions and technology is intricate, fluid and highly situated. The book throws new light on the challenges and benefits of using information and technology in novel ways to implement development programs. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936524

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Redesigning Governance: The Globalization of India’s Digital Public Infrastructure
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936481
DESCRIPTION:India’s digital stack — a combination of biometric IDs, digital payments, and data exchanges — has already had a transformative effect within the country on commerce, social and economic inclusion and the relationship between citizen and state. As a growing number of countries consider adopting elements of the stack, India’s technological innovation is emerging as an essential part of the nation’s efforts to project soft power in a multipolar world. . . . . This panel discussion will surface the key opportunities and risks posed by India’s stack, as well as investigate how we might need to redesign governance to manage this new infrastructure. The event is part of a larger project on DPIs and will feature a short primer on the stack followed by an interactive discussion featuring an inter-disciplinary set of panelists. The event will be moderated by Mihir Kshirsagar (clinic lead, CITP, Princeton) and Akash Kapur (senior fellow, The GovLab, NYU).\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936481

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Necessary Trouble: Growing up at Mid-Century
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937496
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a conversation between two presidents emerita of Harvard and Princeton respectively about Drew Gilpin’s new memoir of coming of age in a conservative Southern family in postwar America.. . . . To grow up in the 1950s was to enter a world of polarized national alliances, nuclear threat, and destabilized social hierarchies. Two world wars and the depression that connected them had unleashed a torrent of expectations and dissatisfactions—not only in global affairs but in American society and Americans’ lives.. . . . A privileged white girl in conservative, segregated Virginia was expected to adopt a willful blindness to the inequities of race and the constraints of gender. For Drew Gilpin, the acceptance of both female subordination and racial hierarchy proved intolerable and galvanizing. Urged to become “well adjusted” and to fill the role of a poised young lady that her upbringing imposed, she found resistance was necessary for her survival. During the 1960s, through her love of learning and her active engagement in the civil rights, student, and antiwar movements, Drew forged a path of her own—one that would eventually lead her to become a historian of the very conflicts that were instrumental in shaping the world she grew up in.. . . . Culminating in the upheavals of 1968, Necessary Trouble captures a time of rapid change and fierce reaction in one young woman’s life, tracing the transformations and aftershocks that we continue to grapple with today. . . . . Drew Gilpin Faust is University Professor of History at Harvard University. She was Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study from 2001 to 2007 and served as Harvard’s president from 2007 to 2018. Faust is the author of several books, including This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War, winner of the Bancroft Prize and a finalist for the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize; and Mothers of Invention: Women of the Slaveholding South in the American Civil War. Shirley Tilghman served as President of Princeton University from 2001-2013 and is Professor of Molecular Biology and Public Affairs at Princeton. In 2002, Discover Magazine recognized her as one of the 50 most important women in science.. . . . Co-presented by Labyrinth Books and the Princeton Public Library and co-sponsored by Princeton University’s Humanities Council and the Program in Gender & Sexuality Studies.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937496

DESCRIPTION:A celebration to honor the deceased. . . Day of the Dead is an Indigenous and Catholic syncretic practice in Mexico and Latin America that remembers and honors the deceased. Day of the Dead in the United States is a place where Latina/o/x communities can gather, honor, remember and claim space. In Latin America, the Day of the Dead is a family-centered celebration, where homes and graves are prepared to honor ancestors and family who have departed and their favorite foods and drink are offered. In the United States, the holiday has also become a cultural and artistic experience, where altar exhibitions and making, processions, and vigils are often accompanied by political messages to point to injustices that have caused unnecessary deaths. These events are celebrated in public and social locations rather than only cemeteries.. . . . All are welcome to bring offerings, photos of deceased family and friends, poetry, or any other thing to share.. . . . Open to the University community and the public.. . . . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937684

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Political Disappointment: A Cultural History from Reconstruction to the Aids Crisis
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937498
DESCRIPTION:In her new cultural history of the United States, Sara Marcus shows how artists, intellectuals, and activists turned political disappointment—the unfulfilled desire for change—into a basis for solidarity. Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, one of the most forceful and clear progressive voices in the US today, joins the author for a conversation.. . . . Marcus argues that the defining texts in twentieth-century American cultural history are records of political disappointment. Through often surprising readings of literature and sound, Marcus offers a new cultural history of the last century, in which creative minds observed the passing of moments of possibility, took stock of the losses sustained, and fostered intellectual revolutions and unexpected solidarities.. . . . In close readings of writings, song, and poetry from figures such as Du Bois to Lead Belly or Audre Lorde, among many others, Marcus shows how defeat time and again gave rise to novel modes of protest and new forms of collective practice, keeping alive the dream of a better world. Disappointment has proved to be a durable, perhaps even inevitable, feature of the democratic project, yet so too has the resistance it precipitates.. . . . Sara Marcus is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Notre Dame and the author of Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution, a finalist for the National Award for Arts Writing. Keeanga Yamahtta Taylor’s Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. She is the author, in addition, of From #Blacklivesmatter to Black Liberation. Yamahtta-Taylor is contributing writer at The New Yorker and professor of African American Studies at Princeton University. . . . . This event is co-sponsored by Princeton University's Humanities Council and English, Music and Gender and Sexuality Studies Departments as well as SPIA in NJ.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937498

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937630
DESCRIPTION:It has many names, inner critic, negative self-talk, negativity bias, superego. Whatever we call it, we are all too familiar with that voice that is always with us. Telling us that we are not good enough, we need to do more, or we don’t belong.. . . . Sometimes that voice in our head can be motivating, but more often than not it’s harmful and causes us to feel distressed. Join us to learn ways to disempower and change our relationship with these inner critical thoughts through the practice of mindfulness and self-compassion. We will also have a relaxing watercolor activity!. . . . With Sue Kim from CPS and TigerWell. . . . Lunch will be provided! Catered sandwiches and snacks.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937630

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935585
DESCRIPTION:If you register for Part 1 on 10/25 then you will automatically be registered for Part 2 on 11/1.. . ** Note that this changed from 10/18 and 10/25 to 10/25 and 11/1. . . . RNA sequencing (rna-seq) is a sequencing technique used to analyze the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment by the transcriptome. RNA-Seq is widely used to perform gene expression quantification to study cellular changes in organisms and microbiomes under different conditions. Single cell sequencing pipelines additionally allow biologists to perform differential expression analysis between groups of cells identified by known markers.The other genes in the identified groups of cells can be compared for more accurate analysis. . . . . Learning objectives: Participants will learn to cleanup and analyze rna-seq sequence libraries and single cell differential expression data using some standard tools popular in the community. The workshop will use some specific tools to perform such analysis with focus on standard results expected from other such tools.. . . . Knowledge prerequisites: Basic Linux and some experience with a scripting language (e.g., Bash, Python, R).. . . . Hardware/software prerequisites: (1) Bring a laptop which can connect to the eduroam wireless network. You will also need to be able to Duo authenticate to use campus resources. (2) Have an SSH client installed on your laptop. (3) Register for an account on Adroit. Make sure you can SSH to Adroit before the workshop.. . . .

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location

DESCRIPTION:In high school, most students focused on completing their math, and other problem-solving assignments, and didn’t emphasize learning FROM these problems. Learning how to solve problems happened in class, from exercises, study guides, and exam reviews—and much more practice. At Princeton many of these opportunities to learn are not available, so students must make the most of their p-sets to build mastery and fluency in using techniques for specific problem types.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935060

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:(Re)Discovery: Modernist Travelogues by Sofia Yablonska, A Daring Ukrainian Woman Globetrotting in the 1930s
LOCATION:161 E. Pyne Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935854
DESCRIPTION:Had social media existed in the 1930s, "Distant Horizons"  — an engrossing travel diary which PIIRS Translator-in-Residence Hanna Leliv is translating into English — would have gone viral, and its author, the self-identified Ukrainian writer and photographer Sofia Yablonska, would have become an instant sensation as a travel blogger with thousands of followers. In this collection of imaginative vignettes, Yablonska describes her round-the-world journey from France to Port Said, Colombo, Saigon, Bangkok, and all the way to Bora Bora. The travelogue not only documents her wanderlust, but invites the reader on an introspective journey from perception to reflection, from mapping foreign terrain to self-mapping.. . . . The figure of Sofia Yablonska is complex and unconventional — just like her writings, which have only recently been rediscovered and properly appreciated. Why should it now be the turn of readers beyond Ukrainian borders to discover Yablonska? What does it take to adequately introduce an earlier cultural production from a less well-represented culture to a contemporary audience? And does it even make sense to do so, given the number of urgent texts dealing with the Russian war against Ukraine that need to be translated and published? This lecture invites participants to reflect on these questions and gain a deeper insight into the vibrant and diverse Ukrainian literature.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935854

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Vodou en Vogue with Eziaku Nwokocha and Manbo Maude Evans
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938046
DESCRIPTION:In Haitian Vodou, spirits impact Black practitioners' everyday lives, tightly connecting the sacred and the secular. As Eziaku Nwokocha reveals in this richly textured book, that connection is manifest in the dynamic relationship between public religious ceremonies, material aesthetics, bodily adornment, and spirit possession. Nwokocha spent more than a decade observing Vodou ceremonies from Montreal and New York to Miami and Port-au-Prince. She engaged particularly with a Haitian practitioner and former fashion designer, Manbo Maude, who presided over Vodou temples in Mattapan, Massachusetts, and Jacmel, Haiti. With vivid description and nuanced analysis, Nwokocha shows how Manbo Maude's use of dress and her production of ritual garments are key to serving Black gods and illuminate a larger transnational economy of fashion and spiritual exchange. This innovative book centers on fashion and other forms of self-presentation, yet it draws together many strands of thought and practice, showing how religion is a multisensorial experience of engagement with what the gods want and demand from worshippers. Nwokocha's ethnographic work will challenge and enrich readers' understandings not only of Vodou and its place in Black religious experience but also of religion's entanglements with gender and sexuality, race, and the material and spiritual realms.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938046

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Everyday Utopia: What 2,000 Years of Wild Experiments Can Teach Us about the Good Life
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937499
DESCRIPTION:Kristen Ghodsee takes us through 2,000 years of audacious utopian thinking and experiments, exploring better ways to arrange our daily lives, plus a globetrotting jaunt to the communities already putting these seemingly fanciful visions into practice today. The groundbreaking feminist historian and political thinker Joan Scott will help guide the journey. Please join us.. . . . Ever since the days of Pythagoras in the 6th century BCE, humans have been dreaming up better ways to organize how we live together, share our property, raise our children, and determine who’s part of our families. Some of these experiments burned brightly for only a brief while—but others carry on today.. . . . Kristen  Ghodsee takes the reader on a tour through history and around the world to explore those places that have boldly dared to reimagine how we might live our daily lives: from the Danish cohousing communities that share chores and deepen neighborly bonds to matriarchal Colombian ecovillages where residents grow all their own food; and from Connecticut, where new laws make it easier for extra “alloparents” to help raise children not their own, to China, where planned microdistricts ensure everything a busy household might need is nearby.. . . . One of those startlingly rare books that upends what you think is possible, Everyday Utopia offers a radically hopeful vision for how to build more contented and connected societies, alongside a practical guide to what we all can do in the meantime to live the good life each and every day.. . . . Kristen R. Ghodsee is a Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the critically acclaimed author of Why Women Have Better Sex Under Socialism: And Other Arguments for Economic Independence. Her writing has been published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Republic, Le Monde Diplomatique, and Jacobin, among other outlets.  Joan Scott’ is professor emerita in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study. She is recognized as one of the foundational feminist historians. Her influential books include Gender and the Politics of History; The Politics of the Veil; The Fantasy of Feminist History; Sex and Secularism; Knowledge, Power, and Academic Freedom; and On the Judgement of History.. . . . Co-presented by Labyrinth Books and the Princeton Public Library and co-sponsored by the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University's Gender and Sexuality Studies Department and SPIA in NJ.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937499

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938004
DESCRIPTION:There is a special thread of continuity between voices, skins and stars that enables us to conjure up this visual essay in exhibition format. An essay formulated, perhaps, in the manner of those who listen to footsteps on the Earth, akin to the practices of healing with plants and to dances of transition and transformation, related to the temporality in which poetry or handicrafts are formed, somewhat outside the classic contemporary discourse on art. We present here a constellation of intuitions, knowledge and practices on the colonial invention of bodies based on the imposition of a hierarchy of skin, sexuality, gender and ethnic identity and the banning of certain individual and community erotic, visual and spiritual practices. We  will attest to the powerful beauty of the invocations against the effects of the colonial trauma and the permanent resistance against it in our bodies. The Rhea’s Footprint (Or How We Transform Silences) enables us to chart a counter-history of the bodies of the constellations of the south, bodies that today we would term transvestite/trans/non-binary.. . . . You are invited to a talk about the exhibition The Rhea's footprint (or how we transform silences) which is currently on display at the Cultural Center of Memory Haroldo Conti in Buenos Aires, Argentina, after being shown at La Virreina Museum of Barcelona and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Panama. The exhibition, curated by Río Paraná (Mag De Santo & Duen Neka'hen Sacch) brings together works by trans, travesti, non-binary, queer and bisexual artists from a diversity of cultures and origins in our Americas. Georgie Sanchez, Ph.D. student in Art & Archeology will be moderating the event.. . . . This event will be held in Spanish, and is free and open to the public. Lunch provided while supplies last.. . . . Sponsors. . Program in Latin American Studies. . Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies. .

DESCRIPTION:Is procrastination an obstacle to maintaining balance and achieving your academic goals? If so, you are not alone. Up to 80% of college students report that procrastination has been a significant issue. Procrastination is not a matter of mere “laziness” and the solution is not simply “better time management”. In order to overcome procrastination, it is vital that you understand its root causes and motivational dynamics. It is also vital to learn an array of (sometimes counter-intuitive) strategies and techniques for dealing with it.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935061

LOCATION:Frist 329, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935078
DESCRIPTION:Grad school reading demands not only increase, but they are likely qualitatively different from what you were asked to read – and how – in college and the working world. Not only are you expected to critically absorb and analyze an immense number of difficult texts of various types, you are expected to do so quickly.   In this workshop we’ll explore techniques to move through texts judiciously and intentionally, while also making notes that you can actually use to deepen your learning.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935078

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:History (Re)incarnate: George Eliot and Qurratalain Hyder
LOCATION:McCosh Hall, Room B14, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937501
DESCRIPTION:In making incarnation a key term for her fiction, George Eliot exemplifies a broader Victorian effort to transmute Christian sentiment into a secular ideal of sympathy and an aesthetic of realism. At the same time, the critical tendency to situate Eliot in relation to a New Testament paradigm has obscured her engagement with cosmologies other than the Christian telos. Disambiguating incarnation from the New Testament legacy — but not from religion — this talk traces Eliot’s interest in forms of ensouled embodiment that take shape in multiple iterations over time. Inspired by calls to reimagine the geographical and chronological boundaries of Victorian studies, this talk pairs Middlemarch (1871-72) with a 20th-century Urdu novel that makes reincarnation its organizing narrative principle: Qurratulain Hyder’s Aag ka Darya (1959)/River of Fire (trans. 1998), a historical epic that sees its characters repeatedly reborn over the course of 2500 years. In examining how both novels theorize history by engaging with Hindu and Buddhist models of spiritual embodiment, this talk demonstrates what becomes possible when we consider the relationship between literary form and religious doctrine outside the Christian context.. . . . Maha Jafri received her Ph.D. from Northwestern University and her B.A. from Johns Hopkins University. She specializes in Victorian literature, with research and teaching interests in the history of the novel and narrative, psychology, ethics, and intellectual history. Her work has appeared in the Oxford Forum for Modern Language Studies and The Henry James Review. She is currently completing a book manuscript titled Between Us: Gossip, Sociability, and the Victorian Novel.. . . . Sponsors:. . Department of English. . University Center for Human Values. .

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:McGraw Center Graduate Workshop: Intro to Reading & Note-making in Grad School
LOCATION:Online Event
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935079
DESCRIPTION:Grad school reading demands not only increase, but they are likely qualitatively different from what you were asked to read – and how – in college and the working world. Not only are you expected to critically absorb and analyze an immense number of difficult texts of various types, you are expected to do so quickly.   In this workshop we’ll explore techniques to move through texts judiciously and intentionally, while also making notes that you can actually use to deepen your learning.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935079

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Towards a New History of Ukraine: Writing Women’s Lives into War and Postwar
LOCATION:Robertson Hall, Room 016 , Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934957
DESCRIPTION:This co-presentation aims to unsettle the way the history of Ukraine has been imagined by venturing into stories that might be found in other historiographies, such as Russian, Eastern European, Polish, Jewish, and Soviet. Exploring the biographies of two women — Dina Pronicheva, a Jewish survivor of Babyn Iar and a puppet theater actress, and Muza Konsulova, an architect involved in postwar rebuilding in Soviet Ukraine — highlights the ways we can reimagine scholarly categories and think differently about women’s lives in the time of war and postwar. Ukraine then becomes central to larger stories of the region.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934957

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Dalits and the Anti-Caste Epistemology: From Oral to Literary Tradition in Telugu Country
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room 144, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936404
DESCRIPTION:Caste is one of human history's oldest forms of inequality, legitimized by Brahmanical knowledge and enforced through caste-based violence and dehumanization. This paper argues that the anti-caste articulations are as old as caste itself. Using the Telugu-speaking areas as a historical site, this paper tracks the anti-caste epistemology articulated by Dalits for centuries in the forms of oral and folk traditions. With the dawn of colonial modernity, anti-caste articulations in the form of literary journals, texts, and political pamphlets in the colonial public sphere challenged caste inequality and Brahmanical power and supremacy. The paper uses Kula (Caste) Puranas of the marginalized communities as an oral resistance tradition and the Telugu publications of Dalits and anti-caste writers to build an alternative anti-caste epistemology that resisted Brahmanical oppression and envisioned egalitarian philosophy of equality and dignity as a precondition for human emancipation.. . . . Chinnaiah Jangam is an associate professor in the Department of History at Carleton University. His research focuses on the social and intellectual history of Dalits in modern South Asia, illuminating the histories of marginalization and resistance through the lens of Dalits. His first book, "Dalits and the Making of Modern India," was published by Oxford University Press in 2017. He is currently working on several projects, including a memoir about his mother and a translation of the Telugu classic "Gabbilam" (The Bat).. . . . This event is part of the 'Power, Inequality, Dissent' series led by Prof. Divya Cherian (History) and Dr. Harini Kumar (History/CGI).. . . . This event is co-sponsored by the Center for Collaborative History, the Department of Comparative Literature, the Program in South Asian Studies, and the Program in Translation and Intercultural Communication.. . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936404

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Rethinking 'Soviet History': Attempts, Compromises, Implications
LOCATION:Robertson Hall, Room 016, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934958
DESCRIPTION:Does “Soviet history” exist? Is it a temporal category, a geographical area, or a political notion? Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has prompted historians to reconsider the directions of their research and rewrite the curricula of their courses. Historians now face a range of new challenges — ideological, ethical, and logistical. One of the most difficult questions concerns the future of “Soviet studies.” Scholars used to think about the Soviet Union as a single state encompassing a multitude of entities — regions and nationalities, former kingdoms turned colonies and republics, and independent countries that were annexed or conquered. Given the diversity of these historical trajectories and experiences, the concept of “Soviet history” may appear now as a misnomer. This seminar invites scholars to discuss the future of “Soviet studies” and to share thoughts and ideas about research and teaching.. . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934958

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Exhibition Thomas Mann: Democracy Will Win! 
LOCATION:East Pyne Lower Hyphen , Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938374
DESCRIPTION:“It is a terrible spectacle when the irrational becomes popular,” said Thomas Mann in his famous speech at the Library of Congress in 1943. The resistance of this famous German author is both inspiring and, alas, deeply relevant today, as we witness the fundamental values of democracy once again being called into question by a increasingly virulent populism and nationalism on both sides of the Atlantic that are putting democratic society under massive pressure.. . . . As a polemical contribution to these current debates, the Princeton German Department is hosting the touring exhibition Thomas Mann: Democracy Will Win! whose spatial and metaphorical center is the Thomas Mann House in Pacific Palisades, California. For it was from this sanctuary in exile that Mann campaigned tirelessly for a new understanding of democracy. Today Mann’s West Coast residence is once again at the service of intellectual exchange and transatlantic understanding.. . . . The first part of the exhibition presents the development of Thomas Mann’s political biography from monarchist to powerful opponent of National Socialism and committed fighter for democracy. Photographs, texts, excerpts from the famous radio addresses “To the German Listeners!” and original exhibits trace his intellectual, political and spatial paths.. . . . The second multimedia section connects this history to the present. What makes a political person? How does one become a supporter of democracy? How does one defend one’s stance? Film clips and interviews, tweets and quotes from personalities from politics, popular culture, literature and society  – ranging from Greta Thunberg to Saša Stanišić, from Donald Trump to Barack Obama, from Igor Levit to Edward Snowden – illustrate the importance of the question: How can we defend and sustainably strengthen democracy as a responsible model of social organisation? This is a task that is more important than ever today, in times of rampant neo-fascisms, global migration, climate change, and new pandemics.. . . . The exhibition is structured around the terms Beginnings, Zeitgeist, Affirmation, Take Action, and Responsibility which convey some of the ambivalences that even a democratic system cannot eliminate. Thomas Mann’s life offers numerous points of departure for examining the current state, the fragility and the future of democracy – inspired by Mann’s dictum: “DEMOCRACY WILL WIN!”. . . .  . . . . The exhibition, which is free and open to the public, will be on view November 6-28 in the Lower Hyphen of the East Pyne Building on the Princeton University Campus.. . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938374

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:France Has an Interventionist State — But It’s Intervening to Serve Capital
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room A71 , Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936480
DESCRIPTION:In today's France, environmental activists, "yellow vests," feminists, associations and citizens are looking for solutions outside government rather than transforming government and public action itself. In this book, Anna-Laure Delatte collects original data from the Treasury and Banque de France since 1949 to document the transformation of public action over 70 years. In short, a key driver of public spending and monetary action today is support for business. This may explain the loss of citizens confidence in government. It also reveals the inability of contemporary public action to cope with climate change and transform the economic framework into a sustainable regime that respects our planet and into one better adapted to the changes already underway in our societies.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936480

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:American Higher Ed Learning Cohort Session 1: An Overview of Higher Education in America
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson 271, Louis A. Simpson 271, Princeton, NJ, United States
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938033
DESCRIPTION:​In this session we will take a broad overview of the development of colleges and universities in America.  This is the first of a two part conversation centering on the question: How did we get here?. . . . Session 1 Readings:. . David Labaree, A Perfect Mess. Chapter 2 (pages 25-45). . . . Nicolas Lemann, “The Soul of the Research University” https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Soul-of-the-Research/146155. . American Higher Ed: History, Culture, and Challenges Cohort Description: . . Designed for graduate students pursuing tenure track careers, as well as those considering a range of careers in and related to higher education, our session topics range from the rise of the PhD as the central academic credential, to graduate education’s role in the research university, to the role of faculty in university governance. Along the way you’ll connect a range of guests, including university press editors, foundation and public humanities leaders, and faculty and administrators from a range of institutions. . . . . This workshop series will take a long view of American higher education, framing its problems and prospects in both current and historical terms. How did we get here? Where are we headed, and why? Where should we be headed? The overarching goal is both broad and simple: that you extend and deepen your understanding of the history and culture of the academic workplace and profession you now occupy, and the fields you hope to enter.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938033

DESCRIPTION:From its inception in the 18th century with Freedom's Journal and on to the present day, the Black Press has been in business to advance the fight for civil and human rights. Most newspapers have struggled to balance their quest for economic viability with their commitment to the empowerment of Black people politically and socially. However, publications serving African-American communities have never been monolithic.. . . . Dr. Clarissa Myrick-Harris, a Professor of Africana Studies at Morehouse College, will present her examination of the Black Press in Atlanta during the critical social movement era of the 1960s and 1970s. The three major Black newspapers of the city:. . . . The Atlanta Daily World (Est. 1928), a politically conservative publication, was born at the height of Jim Crow and sought to cater to the city's Black Middle class.. . . . The Atlanta Inquirer (Est. 1960) was launched to be the mouthpiece of the Atlanta Student Movement, as students in the city's HBCUs waged a nonviolent war against segregation.. . . . The Atlanta Voice (Est. 1966) was conceived to reflect the concerns and actions of Atlanta's diverse Black Community as the Civil Rights Movement ebbed and the Black Power era emerged.. . . . S﻿peaker: Dr. Clarissa Myrick-Harris. . . . Dr. Clarissa Myrick-Harris, a Professor of Africana Studies at Morehouse College, is co-founder of the college’s Black Men’s Research Institute and principal investigator for the Morehouse Movement, Memory, and Justice Initiative. Both are supported by grants from the Mellon Foundation.. . . . Myrick-Harris’ research focuses on the intersection of race, class, culture, and gender in the quest for social change and social justice, with emphasis on leadership during the Civil Rights and Black Power movements.. . . . Her publications include “Call the Women: The Tradition of African American Female Activism in Georgia During the Civil Rights Movement,” in the book Southern Black Women in the Modern Civil Rights Movement, and “Behind the Scenes: Two Women of the Free Southern Theater,” a chapter in Women of the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers & Torchbearers, 1941-1965.. . . . Her recent historical context study for the National Parks Service, How They Lived, focuses on the family home of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King and the childhood home of the first Black mayor of Atlanta, Maynard H. Jackson, Jr. She is currently working on the edited volume, Keep Pushing! The Atlanta Student Movement –From Quest for Human Rights to Demand for Black Power.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938124

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Data Visualization with R (Intermediate Level)- Change of date from 10/26 to 11/9 and change of location
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935903
DESCRIPTION:Want easier ways to make better graphs in R? This workshop is for researchers who have beginner-level experience with R’s ggplot2 package, but would like tools for creating more efficient workflows and improving the appearance of their visualizations. More specifically, this workshop will cover: (1) ggthemes - package that facilitates customization of plots made with ggplot2, (2) camcorder - package that ensures consistent sizing when exporting plots from R (no more meticulous work on an image, only to save it and discover everything looks off!), and (3) overview of options for including multiple plots in one image, often for publication. . . . Time permitting, we may also cover how to make 3D plots, interactive plots, or animated videos.. . . . Workshop format: Presentation and demo, with some optional interactive sections. . . . . Target audience: This workshop is geared toward researchers who use R to create graphics.. . . . Knowledge prerequisites: This workshop requires beginner-level experience using R’s ggplot2 package. If, for example, you’ve created a few of your own visualizations with ggplot2, or you’ve attended some sort of introductory workshop on ggplot2, this workshop is for you.. . . . Hardware/software prerequisites: . . This workshop will use the Adroit training cluster.  . . If you do not already have an account on Adroit, you should request one by filling out the following form *at least* two days before the workshop:. . https://forms.rc.princeton.edu/registration/?q=adroit. . . . Participants should ensure they have met these requirements in advance, as THERE WILL BE NO TECHNICAL TROUBLESHOOTING DURING THE WORKSHOP ITSELF! . . . . Learning objectives: Participants will learn to use R packages that allow them to customize their graphs and create more efficient workflows in R.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935903

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935038
DESCRIPTION:Increasingly, instructors are embracing the flipped classroom as a way to encourage active learning. In a flipped classroom, students engage with course content outside of class (often via short recorded lecture segments) and then complete higher-level, more challenging activities during class, often with their peers. . . . . In this "How to/Why to" session, we will discuss the pedagogy of flipped classrooms, hear from Princeton faculty who have used the approach, and learn about McGraw’s resources to support these active learning strategies.. . . . . . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935038

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Writing to Influence: Turning Academia into Compelling Journalism with Torie Bosch
LOCATION:Online Event
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938197
DESCRIPTION:Writing for Readers: Turning Academia into compelling journalism with Torie Bosch. . . . Torie Bosch grew up in a house where women did tech-her mother was a programmer, before most people knew what that was. She herself did a humanities degree and then successfully pursued a career in science journalism, working for Slate and eventually manging their Future Tense section before moving to join the team at STAT news, where she became the medical outlet’s first opinion editor. Torie has spent two decades turning science and tech-heavy news stories and ideas into compelling journalism, and working with academics to help make their complex research accessible to a wide reading audience. In this workshop, she’ll show you how your work can become news without losing its academic rigour.. . . . Advanced reading materials:. . . . Recent piece edited by Torie on STAT News. . . . About the series: . . In close collaboration with Princeton University Press, Princeton Writes, the Program for Community-Engaged Scholarship, and other partners, this GradFUTURES Learning Cohort will help you hone writing (and other communication) skills in order to connect your ideas with audiences that need to hear them. We’ll cover how to keep your writing clear, interesting, and relevant.. . The series will feature online presentations and in-person, hands-on workshops. You’ll hear from nationally-recognized voices in a series of Zoom Lunch & Learns with Princeton University Press authors like Christopher Paul Harris, Jelani Favors, Marybeth Gasman, Joseph C. Ewoodzie, and Tara Dawson-McGuinness, and you’ll also connect with people and resources that will help you move from theory to practice. In the Spring, you’ll have the chance to earn a badge in public writing—while producing public-facing work of your own in a supportive, mentored environment.\n\nMeeting Link: https://princeton.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIvduygpzojHNdfQC_qnmpnZSbEJMM39hut\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938197

DESCRIPTION:In 2020, Koji Yanai created and commenced the execution of the public toilet renovation project, "The Tokyo Toilet" (TTT) in Shibuya, Tokyo. Representing Japan and featuring 16 internationally renowned creators, including architects at the forefront, this project brought the world's highest level of creativity and design to the often-overlooked realm of urban architecture — the public toilet. Yanai has initiated a new film project to address the challenges of TTT and his debut production, "Perfect Days," which earned the Best Actor award at the 2023 Cannes International Film Festival. . . . . In this talk, Yanai will explain why he embarked on the toilet project, what insights he gained, and why he produced a film at the end of those insights.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937992

DESCRIPTION:The Office of International Programs and the Carl A. Fields Center are convening a series of conversations around identity and international travel. Identity is never monolithic and always intersectional, but each conversation will attempt to address the experiences of one identity, broadly defined. We expect and hope these conversations will be wide-ranging and frank, and provide panelists and audience members with a chance to reflect on how identity shapes the experience of international travel, study, scholarship and work. This panel convenes faculty, staff and students who are part of the Asian community, broadly defined, on campus.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938019

DESCRIPTION:This series of workshops will provide faculty the opportunity to do some guided, hands-on experimentation with generative AI tools, to reflect in community on the experience, and to discuss the tools’ potential impact on our teaching. . . . . DALL-E, Adobe Firefly, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are examples of AI systems that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. Questions we will consider include: How have AI-created images complicated the landscape for media literacy? How might AI-created images affect student projects? How can AI-created images support students with minimal technical or artistic training? How does this tool connect to conceptions of copyright and intellectual property?\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935042

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:McGraw Center Graduate Workshop: Taming Perfection and the Art of "Good Enough"
LOCATION:Frist 329, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935082
DESCRIPTION:Voltaire is credited with claiming “the ‘perfect’ is the enemy of the good.” What if we take this to heart? In this workshop for graduate students across disciplines, we’ll unpack “perfectionism” and explore some of the roots and consequences of this common challenge.  Next, we’ll discuss how unrealistic expectations are linked to both procrastination (trouble starting) as well as to doubts about when we are finished (trouble stopping).  We’ll end with strategies to incorporate the “good enough” approach to productivity and achievement into our lives.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935082

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Triumphalism and the Inconvenient Truth: Correcting National Overconfidence in a Rising Power
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936042
DESCRIPTION:Do people in a rising authoritarian power with pervasive propaganda and information control overestimate their country's reputation, power, and influence in the world? Excessive national overconfidence has both domestic and international consequences, but it has rarely been studied. A survey conducted in 2020 and a pre-registered two-wave survey experiment in 2021 shows that the Chinese public overwhelmingly overestimates China's global reputation and soft power, even during a national crisis. Importantly, informing Chinese citizens of China's actual international image can effectively and significantly correct their factual perceptions of the country's global reputation. It also moderately lowers their evaluations of China and its governing system and their expectations for the country's external success. These effects from simple information interventions are not fleeting, and they indicate that triumphalism and overconfidence can be meaningfully mitigated. The findings are not only of theoretical interest but have significant policy implications.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936042

DESCRIPTION:Over the past few decades, Islam's treatment of women and the LGBTQ community have been the subject of a lot of controversy. This workshop seeks to remove some of the mist hanging around these topics. The first half focuses on gender issues, discussing topics such as the veil, gender roles, and the question of equality. The second half explores Islam's compassionate treatment of same-sex desires and actions. We conclude by asking: what can Islam (lit. peace) offer in the cultural wars today?\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938027

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location

DESCRIPTION:Voltaire is credited with claiming “the ‘perfect’ is the enemy of the good.” What if we take this to heart? In this workshop for graduate students across disciplines, we’ll unpack “perfectionism” and explore some of the roots and consequences of this common challenge.  Next, we’ll discuss how unrealistic expectations are linked to both procrastination (trouble starting) as well as to doubts about when we are finished (trouble stopping).  We’ll end with strategies to incorporate the “good enough” approach to productivity and achievement into our lives.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935083

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Constance Garnett: A Rehabilitation
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room 144, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937151
DESCRIPTION:Constance Garnett’s 1912 translation of "The Brothers Karamazov" set off a craze for Russian literature among English readers, modernists foremost among them. This talk will explore how, as Garnett continued to translate nineteenth-century Russian literature, modernists found dynamic characters, compelling experiments with narrative time, and a new way to create a novel, one in which a study of the inner life is the principal subject matter. Although her translations were later subject to scrutiny and concerns about accuracy, this talk will demonstrate that Garnett was the translator who brought Russian literature to the modernists and whose translations played a key role in the transition away from Victorian letters. This talk will explore Garnett’s signature move as a translator: the co-creation of charismatic and manic characters who speak with the same voice across her translations of work by separate authors. The talk will involve reparative work on Garnett’s translations, which are questionable according to translational norms of both yesterday and today, but function well as modernist translations, following the distinctly modernist calibration of equivalence.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937151

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Decolonization of Higher Education in East Africa
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson International Building, Room 144, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936477
DESCRIPTION:Prof. Chacha Nyaigotti-Chacha Chairman, Kenyan Commission for University Education (CUE). . Higher education in the East African Countries of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda was a creation of the British colonial government right from the 1920s when Makerere College was established as a tertiary institution that trained a few East and Central African students to prepare them to take jobs in support of the economic growth of the United Kingdom. . . . . In this presentation, Chacha Nyaigotti Chacha will seek to demonstrate that since independence in the '60s, higher education in East Africa has experienced an exponential growth of Universities and other tertiary institutions. He will trace this transformation while underscoring how the development of higher education in East Africa contributed to the struggle for freedom and independence from colonial bondage and highlight how the curriculum has evolved allowing both the learners and the lecturers to engage in introspection as they go on to decolonize their minds and culture. He will demonstrate that during the colonial period, the driving force behind the development of education in general and higher education, in particular, was to ensure that there would be an adequate supply of a trained human capital that could be deployed in a strategic economic undertaking whose proceeds would be repatriated to the home country of the colonizers. He will also discuss the question of the curriculum, language, and culture in an attempt to indicate that the use of English in the three countries continues to be a pertinent question that scholars are debating to date.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936477

LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938727
DESCRIPTION:Are you a grad student interested in getting more involved in the arts, public humanities, or engaged scholarship — either during grad school or after you earn your graduate degree? Then join us for the second meeting of the 2023-2024 academic year of the Working in the Creative Arts and Public Humanities cohort (WCAPH).. . . . . . . . We will be meeting at Princeton University Press from 2:00pm-3:30pm on Tuesday, November 21, to meet with representatives from the Press, including Director Christie Henry and Editorial Director of Humanities & Social Sciences Eric Crahan. We will also be joined by Joani Etskovitz and Katherine Hogan — Ph.D. candidates in the English department at Harvard and co-founders of the “Literary Careers” project, designed to help humanities students identify, pursue, and obtain intellectually fulfilling, gainful employment.. . . . How to Arrive: Meet at the William Street courtyard entrance of the building, where we will then be escorted inside the building.. . . . . . Questions? Please reach out to Dylan Blau Edelstein: dylane@princeton.edu. . . . . . About the WCAPH: Initiated during the 2022-23 academic year, this cohort meets with a diverse range of figures working at cultural institutions, both on and off-campus, to explore the reciprocal relationships between performance and research, criticism and production, theory and practice, and administration and academia, while learning about career paths in the public humanities, theater, arts, and GLAMS (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). Last year, this included trips to museums, theaters, historical societies, and more in Washington DC and New York City, as well as extended engagement with Princeton’s own McCarter Theater.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938727

LOCATION:101 Peretsman Scully Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1939000
DESCRIPTION:The gender/sex binary refers to the belief that gender is binary and determined by biological sex. This belief system is widespread in modern Western cultures despite evidence that it does not accurately portray the complexities of gender and sex. . . This talk explores how the gender/sex binary is maintained and why people may be motivated to do so. By further distinguishing between the reasons that those who defend the gender/sex binary voice and the actual reasons for negative reactions to disruptions to the gender/sex binary, the talk highlights the importance of going beyond the discourse and examining the psychological factors underlying the defense and maintenance of the gender/sex binary.. . . .

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Resistance, Repression, and Resilience of Chinese Feminism: A Conversation with the "Feminist Five" Activists
LOCATION:Bowl 016, Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937768
DESCRIPTION:Since the early 2010s, the grassroots Young Feminist Activist (YFA) movement in China has initiated a societal awakening especially among young women. However, the transformative feminist movement soon encountered state repression: in 2015, the “Feminist Five” were arrested and detained for 37 days for their planned anti-sexual-harassment advocacy. . . Against the backdrop of repression, the YFA communities expanded into the diaspora and the Chinese #MeToo movement emerged in 2018, marking the resilience and evolution of Chinese feminism. . . Princeton GSS invites prominent activists and two of the “Feminist Five” – Zheng Churan (Datu), and Li Tingting (Maizi) – for a conversation on the resistance, repression and resilience of feminist activism in China.. . . . This event is co-sponsored by: The Department of East Asian Studies, the Gender + Sexuality Resource Center, the Program in East Asian Studies, and the Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937768

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:NASEM Science of Effective Mentorship in STEMM 
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, United States
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938068
DESCRIPTION:GradFUTURES invites you to a mentorship seminar and networking reception with guest speakers from The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.. . . . Maria Lund Dahlberg, Director of the Board of Higher Education and Workforce at The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, will give an overview of The Science of Effective Mentorship in STEMM (2019) report. The report committee systematically compiled and analyzed research on the characteristics, competencies, and behaviors of effective mentors and mentees in STEMM and developed a report and practical resource guide for research mentors to create and support viable, sustainable mentoring support systems. In the discussion, Ms. Lund-Dahlberg will also highlight the role of mentorship in identity formation, inclusion and wellbeing among graduate students and postdocs. Further, they will announce NASEM’s new Roundtable on Mentorship, Well-being and Professional Development in Scientific Research. The Roundtable seeks out examples of improvements and innovations in supportive services and effective mentorship to ultimately catalyze the creation of a more inclusive and equitable higher education and STEMM research ecosystem. In particular, the Roundtable focuses on the role of identity, inclusion, personal agency, and well-being (e.g., mental, financial, and social) in mentoring relationships and career development of graduate student and postdoctoral scholars in STEMM.. . . . A networking reception at 6 pm in Louis A. Simpson atrium lounge will follow the seminar. \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938068

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Artifactual Forensic and Documentary Knowing 
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935027
DESCRIPTION:Elizabeth Anne Davis' book celebration of her most recent release, "Artifactual Forensic and Documentary Knowing.". . . . In "Artifactual," Elizabeth Anne Davis explores how Cypriot researchers, scientists, activists, and artists process and reckon with civil and state violence that led to the enduring division of the island, using forensic and documentary materials to retell and recontextualize conflicts between and within the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot communities. Davis follows forensic archaeologists and anthropologists who attempt to locate, identify, and return to relatives the remains of Cypriots killed in those conflicts. She turns to filmmakers who use archival photographs and footage to come to terms with political violence and its legacies. In both forensic science and documentary filmmaking, the dynamics of secrecy and revelation shape how material remains such as bones and archival images are given meaning. Throughout, Davis demonstrates how Cypriots navigate the tension between an ethics of knowledge, which valorizes truth as a prerequisite for recovery and reconciliation, and the politics of knowledge, which renders evidence as irremediably partial and perpetually falsifiable.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935027

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Continuous Integration and Automated Software Testing (Date change to 11/30)
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935890
DESCRIPTION:Has your research code ever been broken or given wrong results after you or a collaborator changed something? Have you ever found yourself unable to reproduce some potentially published results? As researchers, we can apply a few basic principles of modern software development to our scientific software development process, both to mitigate the risk of such failures and to save time.. . . . One popular method, referred to as Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD), involves pushing software changes to a shared repository often in order to avoid the issues that result from individual versions of code diverging over time. This talk introduces a simple and tested workflow for scientific software development that relies on Git along with GitHub Actions which is the automatic testing framework from GitHub.. . . . Workshop format: Presentation and hands-on. . . . Target audience: This talk is intended for a wide research audience. Some knowledge of Git fundamental concepts is required . Through examples, it will introduce a workflow based on basic concepts of Git, testing, and automatic testing. There will be a hands-on exercise using GitHub Actions.. . . . Knowledge prerequisites: Prior experience with version control using Git and Github will be necessary to follow the workshop. No prior experience with Jenkins or other automated testing tools is assumed.. . . . Hardware/software prerequisites: Overarching requirements for all PICSciE virtual workshops are listed at https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/education/training/virtual-workshop-requirements. Participants should ensure they have met these requirements in advance, as there will be no technical troubleshooting during the workshop itself. To participate in the hands-on exercise you will need a GitHub account as well as a Linux machine that you have ssh access to. The Adroit cluster would be a good candidate for this.. . . . Learning objectives: Attendees will leave with a clear idea of what can be done with CI and automated testing tools, and, hopefully, some motivation to do it.  Participants will also be armed with concrete information on how to set up Github and GitHub Actions to implement the workflow introduced in the talk for their own software development at Princeton.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935890

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Artist-Led Workshop | MiKyoung Lee: Building Images with Mundane Materials 
LOCATION:Art on Hulfish
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937274
DESCRIPTION:Join the artist MiKyoung Lee as she leads an art-making workshop, in conjunction with her solo exhibition Threading Memories / MiKyoung Lee on view at Art@Bainbridge. Experiment with building abstract and organic forms with pipe cleaners, twist ties, and other found recycled materials. By using familiar and everyday objects, participants will experience how to create art that is both personally expressive and materially linked to our wider consumer, mass-produced world.  . . . . All materials will be provided. Space is limited and registration is required. . .  . . By twisting and knotting, a method akin to weaving, Lee uses common, mass-produced products such as pipe cleaners, zip ties, and twist ties to create dynamic, lush large-scale sculptures as well as intimate two-dimensional, wall-mounted works. The meditative nature of these techniques allows Lee to reflect on and catalogue her memories as she creates; open cavities in many of her works provide metaphorical spaces in which viewers can place their own memories for private contemplation and reflection. \n\nMeeting Link: https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/calendar/2023-12/artist-led-workshop-mikyoung-lee-building-images-mundane-materials\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937274

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Revisiting Cis: A Hidden History
LOCATION:Palmer House | Dining Room, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937503
DESCRIPTION:The Urban Dictionary and the OED agree: ‘cis’ refers to someone whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth. Note the historically and geographically specific jargon of “gender identity” and “sex assigned at birth.” Purportedly, a cis person has never second-guessed, resisted, challenged, or changed the norms associated with their birth sex. Their identity is identical with it. How did we get to such a remarkably narrow term? In this talk, I excavate the still quite hidden history of the term ‘cisgender.’ Unsurprisingly, some of its earliest moments are far more interesting—conceptually and pragmatically—than its mainstream use might suggest.. . . . Perry Zurn is Provost Associate Professor of philosophy at American University, DC. He is also a 2023-2024 fellow at Cornell University’s Society for the Humanities and a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Research in Feminist, Queer, and Transgender Studies. He works primarily in political philosophy, critical theory, and transgender studies. He is the author or editor of seven books. His monographs include Curiosity and Power (2021), Curious Minds (2022), and How We Make Each Other: Trans Poetics at the Edge of the University (forthcoming).. . . . Sponsors:. .

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Polling Wars: How Deep and Wide is Putin’s Popular Support?
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson, A71, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938003
DESCRIPTION:Following Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine, the Kremlin adopted a raft of repressive measures aimed at stifling criticism of the government and opposition to the war. Within days, the context for publicly expressing political opinion, and consequently for survey research in Russia, changed dramatically. These changes raise new questions about the interpretation and reliability of data on public opinion in Russia. . . . . What is the nature of public support for Putin and his war? How deep is it? How wide? With results from a new panel survey, the first to track political attitudes in Russia before and after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Professor of Government at Cornell University Bryn Rosenfeld will discuss domestic public opinion toward Putin and the war and what can (and cannot) be reliably inferred from available evidence. . . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938003

DESCRIPTION:The recent surge of interest in addressing a range of social and environmental concerns through “human-centered design” has been accompanied by growing concern within the design community about the suitability of consumer product development techniques to domains outside the commercial sector. In this talk, I review recent history and criticism of human-centered design and its relation to social and environmental issues. I consider key challenges facing design practice and offer a tentative agenda for next-generation scholarship and creative activity that can contribute to ongoing struggles to advance environmental justice and human dignity.. . . .

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Sex and Gender Complexity in Scientific Research
LOCATION:100 Arthur Lewis Auditorium, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938958
DESCRIPTION:Researchers across disciplines  increasingly recognize the importance of accounting for the intersectional complexity of sex and gender. There is undeniable evidence that sex-related biological variables (such as chromosomes, hormones, external genitalia and internal reproductive structures) develop in ways that cannot be easily sorted to stereotypical binary categories. To further complicate the picture, gender-related social variables (like roles, identities, and behaviors) are temporally and culturally specific, and can shape sex differences. Oversimplified accounts of sex and gender detract from research quality in ways that can harm those the research takes up, or fails to take up. This panel will discuss the importance of, and the challenges posed by accounting for sex and gender complexity in empirical research, as well as the tight relationship between rigor and equity where investigating sex and gender differences is concerned.. . . . Panelists:. . -Mia Miyagi, Postdoctoral Fellow, Center for Computational Molecular Biology and the Data Science Institute, Brown University. . -Agustín Fuentes, Professor, Anthropology, Princeton University. . -Catherine Clune-Taylor, Assistant Professor, Program in Gender and Sexuality, Princeton University. . . . Presented by the Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies. . Organized by Catherine Clune-Taylor. . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938958

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Day With(out) Art Film Screening: Everyone I Know Is Sick
LOCATION:Princeton Garden Theatre
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937849
DESCRIPTION:On the anniversary of Day With(out) Art, a day when cultural organizations raise awareness of HIV and AIDS, remember people who have died, and inspire positive action, the Museum and the Princeton Garden Theatre invite you to a screening of Everyone I Know Is Sick. This program of six videos was commissioned by Visual AIDS to generate connections between HIV and other forms of illness and disability. Introduced by Art Museum Director James Steward. . . . . This screening is free and open to the public. Reserve your free ticket on the Princeton Garden Theatre’s website.  . . . . Inspired by a statement from Cyrée Jarelle Johnson in the book Black Futures, Everyone I Know Is Sick examines how our society excludes disabled and sick people by upholding a false dichotomy of health and sickness. Inviting us to understand disability as a common experience rather than an exception to the norm, the program highlights a range of experiences spanning HIV, COVID-19, mental health, and aging. The commissioned artists foreground the knowledge and expertise of disabled and sick people in a world still grappling with multiple ongoing pandemics. . . . . https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/calendar/2023-12/day-without-art-film-screening-everyone-i-know-sick. . . .

LOCATION:Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building, Room A17, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934969
DESCRIPTION:China’s economy has been booming for decades now. A formidable and emerging power on the world stage, the China that most Americans picture is only a rough sketch, based on American news coverage, policy, and ways of understanding. . . . . Enter Keyu Jin, a world-renowned economist who was born in China, educated in the U.S., and is now a tenured professor at the London School of Economics. A person fluent in both Eastern and Western cultures, and a voice of the new generation of Chinese who represent a radical break from the past, Jin is uniquely poised to explain how China became the most successful economic story of our time, as it has shifted from primarily state-owned enterprise to an economy that is thriving in entrepreneurship, and participation in the global economy.. . . . The New China Playbook will be available for purchase at this event.\n\nMeeting Link: https://princeton.zoom.us/w/91893130026?tk=uy1BZCL3g1DL1959omUIWBZXonVYzY2Ipja9TAW9PsU.DQMAAAAVZUHjKhYwVFBJQmJYQ1JUcTFJZm12RnM4Tld3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA#success\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1934969

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:The Rent Is Too Damn High: A Conversation on Advancing Housing Stability in the Princeton-Trenton Region
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1939069
DESCRIPTION:Full-time workers in the Princeton-Trenton area need to earn $34.62/hour to afford a rent of $2000/month. With 2-bedroom apartments averaging $3370/month in Princeton and $2000/month in Trenton, working families making the minimum wage, or even double that amount, are finding it harder and harder to afford housing. The trends are only getting worse: Mercer County’s homelessness rate grew 34% this year, rents continue to rise due to a tightening housing market, and pandemic-era benefit programs, including eviction moratoriums and federal emergency rental assistance, have ended. . . . . Hear directly from people in the community working to address these challenges — from a coalition of government agencies, nonprofits, and church congregations joining forces to provide emergency rental assistance, to grassroots advocacy groups promoting affordable housing development, zoning reforms, and other policies that take aim at housing insecurity. . . . . Moderated by Liz Lempert, Pace Center Community Partner-in-Residence, former Princeton Mayor, and Housing Initiatives of Princeton board chair.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1939069

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Cast in Bronze: An Interactive Workshop in Metalwork  (Part 1 of 2)
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938081
DESCRIPTION:Since antiquity, casting in metal has been used for the production of both decorative sculpture and utilitarian goods. Durable, reproducible, and aesthetically versatile, these objects were the result of hours of intense, messy, and risky labor in the foundry, working with temperatures high enough to fuse liquid metal into bronze. The sixteenth century metallurgist, Vannoccio Biringuccio, once described the foundry as both an Inferno and a Paradise, so chaotic and dangerous but “in which sparkled all the beauty of genius and the power of art.” Straddling science, art, and engineering, casting is characterized by its very interdisciplinarity, and this workshop aims to introduce participants across fields and specialties firsthand to the complex art of modeling, casting, and finishing bronze. In this workshop, we invite participants into the foundry of Biringuccio – real and imagined – in a two-day bronze casting event at the Seward Johnson Atelier in Trenton, NJ, an industrial studio specializing in the fabrication, conservation, and treatment of metal sculpture. Participants will design, carve, and cast their own two-part sand mold, for which materials, tools, and instructions will be provided by skilled practitioners of the Atelier. Together students will learn the general processes of casting and take part in the sculpting, mold making, and bronze pour of their designs (Day 1), before applying a variety of hot and cold patinas to protect and color their castings (Day 2). We are excited to introduce more Princeton students and scholars to the Atelier’s technical resources and hope to inspire future collaborations.. . . . Participants must sign up for Cast in Bronze Parts 1 and 2.. . . . Meet the Facilitator:. . Sharifa Lookman is a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Art and Archaeology, specializing in sixteenth and seventeenth-century Italian sculpture. Janna Israel is the Andrew W. Mellon Curator of Academic Engagement of the Princeton University Art Museum, where she works across the collections to facilitate teaching and interpretation. She is currently completing her book project, The Nature of Ores: Early Modern Metalwork. Nick Valenza is the Production Lead in the Paint and Patina Department at the Seward Johnson Atelier. Megan Uhaze Ware is the Restoration Lead in the Paint and Patina Department at the Seward Johnson Atelier.. . . . What to Expect:. . Cast in Bronze: An Interactive Workshop in Metalwork - Part 1. . . . To request accommodations for this event, please contact the workshop or event facilitator at least 3 working days prior to the event.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938081

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:To Better the World: Why Moral Clarity Matters
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936748
DESCRIPTION:Too often, we focus on the instrumental in our pursuit of justice. We believe that injustice is a puzzle that can be solved if we’re clever enough. That an app, gadget, technology, or business model can address injustice. These are all important. But the root of our crises, from climate change to disenfranchisement, are moral: they result when people do wrong. Thus, the work of justice requires, above all else, moral clarity. But what does moral clarity look like in practice, and how is it different from moral certitude or moralism? We will begin by exploring the nature of a just world – what is it that we’re working towards? We will examine the centrality of idealism and clear moral language and arguments. Next, we will study the nature of injustice: how is it constituted and maintained, why it is so durable and how it shape-shifts through the ages. Finally, we will illustrate how accompaniment – journeying with the wronged, literally and figuratively, until right is done – is a morally and tactically powerful tool in our perennial quest for justice.. . . . Meet the Facilitator:. . I work at the Keller Center to engage the humanities and social sciences in addressing societal challenges. I co-founded a non-profit that provides healthcare to the rural poor in India. I am also a Fellow of the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT. I previously taught "Entrepreneurship for the idealist.". . . . What to Expect:. . Single Workshop. . . .

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Dog Training with Diana
LOCATION: Sign in to download the location
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936758
DESCRIPTION:Would you like to develop a closer bond with your pet? Maybe teach your dog to shut doors and turn off lights? Or just to encourage less pulling on the leash? How about teaching your cat to give you a high 5? This workshop will teach you the fundamentals of "clicker" training with some fun applications. We'll start with how to "load the clicker" (Pavlov's classical conditioning), and then move into capturing, targeting, and shaping behaviors (operant conditioning). All lessons involve 100% positive reinforcement. Leave your own pets at home for this session so we can focus on the star of the show, Princess Diana. Diana is a rescue who is mostly Doberman, with a natural tail and natural ears. She'll show us what she knows, and we'll apply our own lessons in the class to advance her learning right before our very eyes!. . . . Meet the Facilitator:. . James Raymond Vreeland is a professor of politics and international affairs in the Politics Department and the School for International and Public Affairs. He joined Princeton in 2018 after a decade of teaching at Georgetown and another decade at Yale. He did his PhD at NYU. Dog training is his hobby. Dogs and dog training have always been a big part of his life. He has done volunteer work at shelters and rescues, and in 2016, he completed the Karen Pryor Academy Dog Trainer Foundations course.. . . . What to Expect:. . Mini Workshop. . . . To request accommodations for this event, please contact the workshop or event facilitator at least 3 working days prior to the event.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936758

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Following the Money: From the Clinic to the University
LOCATION:Palmer House, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937506
DESCRIPTION:In this talk, I argue that the most significant institutional shift in trans studies, from university gender clinic to liberal arts program, entailed two necessary recalibrations: first, in recognition of who was qualified to teach; and second, a broader, seismic shift in what pedagogy itself might mean for the field.. . . . Drawing on John Money's archives at Johns Hopkins and at the Kinsey Institute, I trace the history of gender clinics in the United States to their closures, and the founding of trans studies as a humanist, liberal arts project. This talk explores how trans gender became institutionalized-first as a medical field, then as an interdisciplinary humanist one-and to what ends. Finally, I trace how the shift from gender clinic to humanities program impacted the way trans narratives were received and address the role of trans studies in the university today.\n\nMeeting Link: https://princeton.zoom.us/j/95459607979?pwd=a01pT2hyZlExMnhsZUNvNDRhR0VUUT09\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937506

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Education for All: Cultural Narratives and Education for the Masses in Britain and Denmark?
LOCATION:Louis A. Simpson, A71 , Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937310
DESCRIPTION:Why did Denmark develop mass education for all in 1814, while Britain created a public-school system only in 1870 and primarily educated academic achievers? Fiction writers are the protagonists of this story, as their literary narratives inspired education campaigns over the long nineteenth-century. Danish writers imagined mass schools as the foundation for a great society and economic growth. Their depictions fortified the mandate to educate all the people: neglecting low-skill youth would waste societal resources and threaten the social fabric. British authors pictured mass education as harming social stability, lower-class work, and national culture. Their stories of youths who overcame structural injustices with individual determination made it easier to blame students who failed to seize educational opportunities. This book is for people who care about educating children of all abilities, are baffled by culture wars over public policy and worry about the future of collective action in our dystopian world.. . . . Introduction by Sophie Meunier . . . . Organized by the Program in Contemporary European Politics and Society . . Co-sponsors: European Union Program and the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination. . \n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937310

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:“Throw Down and Haunt!!!”: The Spectre of Disability at Pennhurst Asylum
LOCATION:Palmer House, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937509
DESCRIPTION:This talk offers an ethnographic analysis of the Pennhurst Asylum, a haunted attraction primarily staffed by disabled performers, located on the site of a former custodial institution for disabled people. It unmasks how the attraction’s immersive performances mix fact with fantasy and obscure ongoing violence against disabled people. The Pennhurst Asylum attraction serves as a bracketed performance space by creating a bounded, safe, aestheticized experience of an institution. This space exposes profound societal fears around the performative aspects of the “spectre of disability,” performances that reinforce perceptions of disability as the ghost of ability lost. This bracketed performance space also conceals ongoing acts of violence perpetrated against disabled people in institutions, all the while transferring embodied knowledge about disability, care, and violence. While this violence evades the review of both society and the justice system, the Pennhurst Asylum attraction, through its location in this former institution, captures this violence, making it possible for review. Finally, the Pennhurst Asylum not only reveals nondisabled society’s willingness to commodify institutional violence, but it also creates a space and a mode of performance—haunting—where disabled people unsettle nondisabled ontological assumptions of disability that returns political agency back to the spirits of the former Pennhurst inmates.\n\nMeeting Link: https://princeton.zoom.us/j/95632145486?pwd=bEFjVU95cHJzZUVma3N6Zld3ZC8xdz09\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937509

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:2024 Meredith Miller Memorial Lecture: Kim TallBear
LOCATION:TBD
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938207
DESCRIPTION:Kim TallBear, author of Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science (2013), is Professor in the Faculty of Native Studies, University of Alberta. She is also Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Peoples, Technoscience, and Society. In addition to studying genome science disruptions to Indigenous self-definitions and the colonial ethics historically of genomic and other physical sciences, Dr. TallBear studies colonial disruptions to Indigenous sexual relations. She also studies and promotes Indigenous scientific and cultural challenges to settler-colonial study and objectification of Indigenous populations and our social and cultural practices.. . . . You can follow her research group related to Indigenous science, technology and society (Indigenous STS) at https://indigenoussts.com/ that she co-founded with her Faculty of Native Studies colleague, Assistant Professor, Jessica Kolopenuk. TallBear has published research, policy, review, and opinion articles on a variety of issues related to science, technology, environment, sexualities, and Indigenous peoples in academic and popular journals including Wicazo Sa Review, Social Studies of Science; Science, Technology, & Human Values, Journal of Law Medicine & Ethics, Journal of Research Practice, Indian Country Today, Buzzfeed, and High Country News as well as in edited volumes published by University of Chicago Press and Routledge .. . . . Dr. TallBear co-founded and co-produces the sexy storytelling and cabaret show, Tipi Confessions, with McMaster University professor Tracy Bear (Nehiyaw’iskwew from Montreal Lake Cree Nation), and with Native Studies PhD student Kirsten Lindquist (Cree-Métis). Tipi Confessions is an offshoot of the popular Austin, Texas show, BedPost Confessions. After seeing the success of the Tipi Confessions show in Edmonton and across Canada, TallBear, Bear, and Lindquist founded a research-creation group, Re-Lab: Restory, Research, and Reclaim, in which faculty, students, and community members produce creation informed research and research informed creative works and performance.. . . . Kim TallBear is a citizen of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate in present-day South Dakota and is also descended from the Cheyenne & Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, where she is also eligible for citizenship. TallBear "immigrated" across the settler-imposed border between the "USA" and "Canada" in 2015. In reality, she only moved across vast territories inhabited by her Peoples and ancestors for millennia. In addition to the aforementioned Indigenous nations, TallBear has ancestry among Cree, Métis, and Anishinaabe Peoples. But since ancestry alone is not a claim, she would never assert that she is more than a distant relation to individuals among those Peoples. She is grateful to be living now in amiskwaciy-wâskahikan (Edmonton), Treaty 6 territory, a traditional gathering place for diverse Indigenous peoples including Cree, Blackfoot, Métis, Nakota Sioux, Iroquois, Dene, Ojibway/ Saulteaux/Anishinaabe, Inuit, and many others.. . . . Dr. TallBear tweets @KimTallBear. You can read her regular pre-academic essays/posts on her Substack newsletter, Unsettle: Indigenous affairs, cultural politics & (de)colonization. Dr. TallBear is also a regular panelist on the weekly podcast, Media Indigena, which is hosted by Rick Harp.\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938207

SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:“We Are a Fantasy”: Trans Latina Ways of Knowing, Being, and Loving
LOCATION:Palmer House, Princeton, NJ 08544, , 
URL:https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937579
DESCRIPTION:During ethnographic research conducted on the West Side of Chicago, many sex working transgender Latinas asserted “somos una fantasía” (“we are a fantasy”) to articulate how they are objectified in sexual economies of labor and in the U.S. nation-state more broadly. However, I argue that fantasía indexes much more. . . In this talk I introduce fantasía as a racialized trans analytic that emerged from sex working trans Latinas’ lived experiences. While recognizing how trans Latina sex workers are fantasized, fantasía is attentive to how trans Latinas critically embody, rearticulate, and resist the ways they are fantasized. Moreover, fantasia demonstrates how sex working trans Latinas actively fantasize other ways of knowing, being, and loving. Fantasía moves beyond narratives of hyper-victimization, and honors trans of color creativity that refuses—sometimes partially and contradictorily—transnormativity and normative Latinidad.\n\nMeeting Link: https://princeton.zoom.us/j/97629054101?pwd=RS85dmhITm50MWw0bnRWUFBvOEhndz09\n---\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1937579
