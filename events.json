In \"Artifactual,\" Elizabeth Anne Davis explores how Cypriot researchers, scientists, activists, and artists process and reckon with civil and state violence that led to the enduring division of the island, using forensic and documentary materials to retell and recontextualize conflicts between and within the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot communities. Davis follows forensic archaeologists and anthropologists who attempt to locate, identify, and return to relatives the remains of Cypriots killed in those conflicts. She turns to filmmakers who use archival photographs and footage to come to terms with political violence and its legacies. In both forensic science and documentary filmmaking, the dynamics of secrecy and revelation shape how material remains such as bones and archival images are given meaning. Throughout, Davis demonstrates how Cypriots navigate the tension between an ethics of knowledge, which valorizes truth as a prerequisite for recovery and reconciliation, and the politics of knowledge, which renders evidence as irremediably partial and perpetually falsifiable.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935027"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081600", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20230911T140049", "CREATED": "20230911T120000", "SEQUENCE": "1", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Climbing \"": "https://my.princeton.edu/CLIMB/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/CLIMB/rsvp_boot?id=1936218#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "CLIMB", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Sports Club Event", "DTSTART": "20231128T213000Z", "DTEND": "20231128T233000Z", "UID": "fab40c725983af1b418f924e4083b9c19112023_2:00:01_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Climbing Team Practice", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936218", "DESCRIPTION": "climbing team practice\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1936218"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081600", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231026T153513", "CREATED": "20231026T120000", "SEQUENCE": "1", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Princeton Playhouse\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/playhouse/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/playhouse/rsvp_boot?id=1938136#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PLAYHOUSE", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Meeting", "DTSTART": "20231128T213000Z", "DTEND": "20231128T233000Z", "UID": "99a62db210915ee4359df471d344973b10262023_3:35:10_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Playhouse Choir Rehearsal", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938136", "DESCRIPTION": "McAlpin Hall\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1938136"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T074125", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231125T203159", "CREATED": "20230907T120000", "SEQUENCE": "7", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Bloom": " A Graduate Wellness Collective\":https://my.princeton.edu/bloom/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/bloom/rsvp_boot?id=1935951#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "BLOOM", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Student Organization Event", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags": "Diversity & Inclusion,Mentorship,Self-care,Wellness & Community,Personal Well-being & Effectiveness", "DTSTART": "20231128T214500Z", "DTEND": "20231128T230000Z", "UID": "ee06f23711e8f72a47387af19c8795b9972023_4:44:28_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "BLOOM: Managing Financial Anxiety Featuring Aja Evans, LMHC ", "LOCATION": " Sign in to download the location", "URL": "https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935951", "DESCRIPTION": "What money stories do you tell yourself, and how do they influence your holistic health?

Have you ever found yourself unable to reproduce some potentially published results? As researchers, we can apply a few basic principles of modern software development to our scientific software development process, both to mitigate the risk of such failures and to save time.. . . . One popular method, referred to as Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD), involves pushing software changes to a shared repository often in order to avoid the issues that result from individual versions of code diverging over time. This talk introduces a simple and tested workflow for scientific software development that relies on Git along with GitHub Actions which is the automatic testing framework from GitHub.. . . . Workshop format: Presentation and hands-on. . . . Target audience: This talk is intended for a wide research audience. Some knowledge of Git fundamental concepts is required . Through examples, it will introduce a workflow based on basic concepts of Git, testing, and automatic testing. There will be a hands-on exercise using GitHub Actions.. . . . Knowledge prerequisites: Prior experience with version control using Git and Github will be necessary to follow the workshop. No prior experience with Jenkins or other automated testing tools is assumed.. . . . Hardware/software prerequisites: Overarching requirements for all PICSciE virtual workshops are listed at https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/education/training/virtual-workshop-requirements. Participants should ensure they have met these requirements in advance, as there will be no technical troubleshooting during the workshop itself. To participate in the hands-on exercise you will need a GitHub account as well as a Linux machine that you have ssh access to. The Adroit cluster would be a good candidate for this.. . . . Learning objectives: Attendees will leave with a clear idea of what can be done with CI and automated testing tools, and, hopefully, some motivation to do it.  Participants will also be armed with concrete information on how to set up Github and GitHub Actions to implement the workflow introduced in the talk for their own software development at Princeton.\\n---\\nEvent Details: https://my.princeton.edu/rsvp?id=1935890"}, {"DTSTAMP": "20231128T081600", "LAST-MODIFIED": "20231121T084054", "CREATED": "20230908T120000", "SEQUENCE": "3", "ORGANIZER;CN=\"Princeton Institute for International & Regional Studies\"": "https://my.princeton.edu/PIIRS/", "CONTACT": "https://my.princeton.edu/PIIRS/rsvp_boot?id=1936025#event_host", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym": "PIIRS", "CATEGORIES;X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type": "Forum/Panel Discussion", "DTSTART": "20231130T170000Z", "DTEND": "20231130T183000Z", "UID": "4989197b8e778fb65e52d9f5ef7eb2bc982023_12:59:13_PM@campusgroups.com", "SUMMARY;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE": "Politics and Information-Digital Technologies: Debating Peril and Promise", "LOCATION": "Louis A.

There is undeniable evidence that sex-related biological variables (such as chromosomes, hormones, external genitalia and internal reproductive structures) develop in ways that cannot be easily sorted to stereotypical binary categories. To further complicate the picture, gender-related social variables (like roles, identities, and behaviors) are temporally and culturally specific, and can shape sex differences. Oversimplified accounts of sex and gender detract from research quality in ways that can harm those the research takes up, or fails to take up. This panel will discuss the importance of, and the challenges posed by accounting for sex and gender complexity in empirical research, as well as the tight relationship between rigor and equity where investigating sex and gender differences is concerned.. . . .

This screening is free and open to the public. Reserve your free ticket on the Princeton Garden Theatre\u2019s website.  . . . . Inspired by a statement from Cyr\u00e9e Jarelle Johnson in the book Black Futures, Everyone I Know Is Sick examines how our society excludes disabled and sick people by upholding a false dichotomy of health and sickness. Inviting us to understand disability as a common experience rather than an exception to the norm, the program highlights a range of experiences spanning HIV, COVID-19, mental health, and aging. The commissioned artists foreground the knowledge and expertise of disabled and sick people in a world still grappling with multiple ongoing pandemics. . . . . https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/calendar/2023-12/day-without-art-film-screening-everyone-i-know-sick. . . .
